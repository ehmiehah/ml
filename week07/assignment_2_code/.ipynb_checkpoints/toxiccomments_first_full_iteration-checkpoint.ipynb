      "Greece is a country which was part of the Ottoman Empire, where a lot of people are Turks, where they speak some dialect and they want to have the Macedonian name. This is my opinion about your country and these are also facts.  You once were part of the Ottoman Empire, you have big Turkish minority in the eastern part of the country, every part of Greece uses some specific dialect of the greek language and you are claiming the ownership of the name Macedonia. About the Macedonian language: this language is recognized as official in our country and it is different from any other language in the world.  That fact is recognized by many relevant international linguistic institutions. I can assure you have many friends in Macedonia that simply don't understand Bulgarian at all. Simply, Macedonian language is not a dialect of Bulgarian no matter how much you are truing to repeat that hoping that it will become true.\n",

      "I've undone your revert on the intro to this article, because although it's in good faith, I think it's mistaken. The reason you gave was that the information is elsewhere in the article, which is already long, so the intro shouldn't cover it even in summary, as it's in the main body under \"\"History\"\". Although I respect your intent of keeping it concise and avoiding redundancy, the Manual of Style for the intro is quite clear:\n",
      " The lead serves as an introduction to the article and a summary of its most important aspects ... [It] should be able to stand alone as a concise overview. It should define the topic, establish context, explain why the topic is notable, and summarize the most important points, including any prominent controversies ... The lead is the first part of the article most people read, and many only read the lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue here is that the intro currently says that state bans were declared unlawful in 2015, 38+ states provided some rights as from 2003, and Windsor gave federal rights in 2013. There needs to be some mention of the backdrop and prior controversies as they were huge, and an increase from 2 to 3 paras to add substance on the background + context is (in my view) appropriate: even very long articles still need a proper introduction that summarizes their contents. Take a look at African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–68) for an example of the intro to a long-ish article. \n",

While it may be argued as reason for general economic inefficiency of the USSR during its later years it is completely out of place as a reason for space exploration setbacks in this article. First of, it was precisely the central planning that made Soviet space program possible. Without centrally allocated resources and planned activities it would never see the light of day nor would it be able to compete against a similar space program undertaken by the wealthiest nation on the planet. Secondly, the US space program (or any large technological program, Manhattan Project being such an example) is equally 'centrally planned', financed and controlled. Very little if anything is left to the works of free market forces. Similarly the US space program has its own also sadly impressive list of setbacks and disasters.

I think we can be certain he earned the titles. The frustrating thing has been finding truly independent sources. My hope is that someone somehow can come up with better sourcing for this. I guess gray sources are better than none.  Then there is the AfD debate. Does the fact the sport lacks main stream media coverage mean the sport and its champion's are not encyclopedic? Again a gray area, but sometimes if one is to risk erring, it's better to err on the side of the article if one cannot find certainty.

The protests were aimed at Turkey and the imposed austerity measures and the fact that they want to be independent and manage their own affairs. So effectively they feel they're not independent but under occupation (or if you don't like the word, under the \"\"control\"\" of Turkey).  Back to the issue, the Nicosia article should have the same information/structure as the Cyprus article. In fact the the TRNC (or the occupation for that matter) isn't even mentioned in the Cyprus infobox. That's why North Cyprus exists. We have to be consistent. Otherwise what's the point of having North Nicosia? Lefkoşa Distict should be mentioned there. To me it makes sense for Nicosia to represent the RoC (as it officially does) and North Nicosia to represent the TRNC. You can't have both.   \"\n",

And NK as a region is separated from Armenia by Kelbajar, Lachin and other districts of Azerbaijan. The sources above do not say that NK existed as a stand alone region historically. Even Russian imperial administrative divisions such as Jevanshir and Shusha uyezds included both mountainous and lowland parts of the region. So we need to clarify that NK as a region did not border Armenia. If we are talking about geographic region of Karabakh, then its mountainous part extends right to the border with Armenia, however upper and lower Karabakh historically formed a single region, and geographic concept of Karabakh includes both highlands and lowlands. The history of NK as a historical and political notion starts in 1920s, when it was artificially carved out of Karabakh to become an autonomy for Armenians.

      "The main Wikipedia \"\"Patricia Cornwell\"\" page is not only libelous, defamatory, false and misleading, but it is also being used to support felony crimes of fraud and extortion. The page itself is a felony criminal act of obstruction of justice, because it uses the Wikipedia public forum to give a false report of previously committed crimes. Wikipedia contributors may face felony indictment as well as civil charges by maintaining these materials online.\n",

      "As shown in court filings and public documents, Cornwell hired thugs to threaten to have me illegally jailed and murdered, and funded a fraud scheme in a Southern court to try and ban my freedom of speech.

I would have no objection to using one or more of the readings you mention for external links.  This article cannot be a place to debate Speer back and forth, to say he was lying about this or not lying about the other thing, that would take far more than the 60K or so that an article should not exceed.  I've looked at the German article; they've tsken rather a different route, which is their privilege.  Notably, it is not a FA on the German Wikipedia, or, by my poor reading of German, even close (they've plainly borrowed from this article, by the way).  We set forth Speer's life in a comprehensive and engaging fashion, draw no conclusions, leave the reader to make up his mind and show him a few resources where he can go if he wants to learn  more beyond the summary style we are forced to use.  To get into \"\"well, this historian says one thing, another says something else\"\" would diminish this article, not add to it.

The image could be used in the treatment subsection (where I originally placed it) or somewhere else in the article, but the top image should be as singularly \"\"cystic fibrosis\"\" as the title itself. For diseases like, off the top of my head, lupus, clubfoot, ALS, spina bifida, or Downs syndrome, images of people could be very suitable for the lede. But for other diseases, a picture of a person suffering from the disease really doesn't work - a person with a runny nose could have the flu, or could just have allergies. There's nothing so strikingly visual about how the flu manifests itself in a human being that justifies a picture of a person with the flu in the lede when a picture of the bug itself can be used. Same with Tay-Sachs, or Alzheimers, or AIDS - none of these articles have a picture of a human being in their lede, and for good reason. It's an article about cystic fibrosis, not \"\"living with\"\" cystic fibrosis, and as such, we should strive to present readers with an image that's as singularly CF as possible. The image of the girl is cute and touching and is suitable enough for the \"\"treatment\"\" section, but is unfitting of being the lead image in the article.   \"\n",

      "I agree with Travellingcari. The tags serve a useful purpose, even after the article is brought to AfD, and especially so when they have been on the article for a significant length of time. They make it clear to visiting editors that any interested parties have had a fair chance to improve the article, and hadn't, which is often a point used in support of deletion. Conversely, if the article isn't tagged, it's not clear that interested parties have been given a chance to improve the article, which may be used to support a keep argument. Removing the tag makes the status either way less clear. Yes, it's available in the history, but why make editors go through the extra work of checking the history? In addition, an AfD can end without reaching a consensus, which means the tag most likely still applies and would have to be restored. No, the time to remove the tag is after a consensus has been reached at the AfD that the subject does meet the notability guidelines, i.e. after it is closed with result keep (or in some cases, when the eventual outcome is clear per WP:SNOW).

      " you have one observer\n",
      " The observer gets cloned into copy 1 and copy 2 (either Hubert/Yorick or star-trek style)\n",
      " The copies diverge, either because of internal noise, or because of the environment\n",
      "\n",
      "From a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say \"\"I am copy 1\"\" and copy 2 will say \"\"I am copy 2\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).  \"\n",

I think a lot of it is a matter of just doing it on a day-to-day basis in every discussion we have on WP, whether on an article talk page, a deletion discussion, or at VP.  Maybe there could be a guideline (or even just an essay) urging people not to rely on rote policy citation regurgitation in lieu of substantive explanation (maybe there already is one somewhere?).  And reminding people that citing policy is at best only half the work: you may have settled on what you think governs the issue, but you still need to convince others of the best way to apply it in a particular circumstance.  To do it properly the focus should always be on what the best editorial decision is, not just the superficial level of what complies with codified policy or guidelines.

      "Hello! That's not right. This is only so, if in each place a significant proportion of the population lives there (25%) or are the majority. I was 1000 times in nordern Serbia and I have seen 100 villages and towns where only the Serbian city name exists, also in the road signs at the city entrance,  so dont tell me this. On numerous road signs, in many countries of Western Europe, Germany, France, Holland, there are more minorities and whose number is much, much larger and there are the city names in German language only. Berlin, Cologne, Dusseldorf ect. I have no problem with any language, but I hope to enjoy in the frame of WP the equal rights for all, as well as justice and above all no double moral. In Vukovar I do not see that you are striving so to put Serbian-Cyrillic version in the infobox, and there ar Serbians over 25%. In Croatia, there are also other locations where Serbs and other minorities live, but their share of the total population is not so much, so I added not there the Serbian name. So it should be also in Serbia. In Novi Sad are not even 4% of Hungary, and for the city names in other languages where are the minorities of a city are not significante, we have the section name, so what ist the problem?. If the Hungarians in Novi Sad 25%, I will add the Hungarian citiy name, but they arent. In other locations thats totaly OK, becaus they are the Hungarians the majority, but in Novi Sad no. After your version every location must have 5-6 name in the infobox and the road sig ns, but forget it, I and you not thats not true, so dont tell me this, i visited the whole Balkan 100 times. In the whole World, Novi Sad is official, or do you see for Wien the Serbian city name Bec? So, accept the piecfull situation and consensus like before, wher we was agreed to put the city name of a minority language, if they have 25 % share of the total population.

Ya well the mere existence of those Neil Armstrong fairy tales and maniacs who are still deluding themselves into thinking shit like that could have actually occured in 1969 is the ultimate vandalism of human culture on this planet in general. I looked into this Apollo nonsense in greater detail than I would have liked to. To the extent of trying to correspond with NASA. There is no such thing as a Neil Armstrong or anybody else actually going to the moon anytime soon, nevermind the 60s. If you look carefully at these so-called TV broadcasts of those events they look as outrageously unrealistic and disgustingly fake as Ed Wood movies.

The domestic law firms which have recruited students from NUJS include Luthra & Luthra Law Offices, Amarchand Mangaldas, AZB & Partners, Trilegal, Economic Law Practice, Wadia Ghandy & Co. and many others. Among companies, ICICI Bank, Reliance Infocomm, Tata Sons, Infosys, Satyam, ITC and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and many more were the major names which have recruited from campus. The Securities and Exchange Board of India(SEBI), the capital markets regulator in India have also recruited students from NUJS. Some graduates, albeit a minuscule number, pursue careers in litigation by joining the chambers of Senior Advocates in the Supreme Court of India or various High Courts & Trial Courts. Some graduates have also embarked on a career in law teaching.

      "Anti-Serb sentiment is an umbrella term or generalization, obviously it will be poorly sourced just as List of Massacres in the Kosovo war is a WP creation. We find a subject then we link sources/stories to it but many articles do not represent a real world phenomenon. The fact is that Serbophobia as a concept is not a \"\"myth\"\" but it is confined to the nation's sympathizers and is rejected by the nation's detractors. Obviously Serbophobia is more degrading and more emphatic than \"\"anti-Serb sentiment\"\" in that implies an outright hatred. Naturally no Serb can truly accept no nation recognizing their declared states in Croatia (Krajina) and Eatern Bosnia during the Yugoslav Wars, seeing a West-brokered peace deal in 1994 putting at end to Bosniak-Croat hostilities then all uniting for a joint attack to end the Serb rebel states alongside world powers and claiming that the unlawful grounds for existence of those states was that they were not AVNOJ entities - and then a few years later support the UCK in Kosovo, pushing from the first moment to have FRY forces expelled, succeeding after airstrikes then nine years later recognize Kosovo - no AVNOJ argument there. But it doesn't end there, Kosovo achieved widespread positive feedback from US recognition to \"\"welcoming of independence\"\" from organizations such as the Basque authority in Spain - all entitled to their own opinions, but Serbs who claim Serbophobia are neither stupid nor blind to world events. You don't get the same positive and warm reception let alone recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia nor many other would-be states to exist or to have existed before being retaken by an aggressor (in the eyes of locals). These feats give Serbs to feel they are victims of international protectionism and that alone is enough to prove the sentiment. You're not going to convince them with fairy stories about how their heavy-handed 1990s oppression or disproportionate number of atrocities that time influenced on what side nations would eventually fall.

      "And what do \"\"quanta\"\" and \"\"cosmology\"\" have in common?  Energy.  To simply categorize physics as \"\"the study of everything\"\" is imperceptive.  When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain \"\"bulk\"\" properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.  While the duality may sound a bit contrived, there is definitely some truth to the statements, and while not perfect, it's more meaningful than what's there now.\"\n",

      "According to Ralph Keyes, the quote in the article \"\"I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong... No Viet Cong ever called me nigger\"\" is a misquotation.  Keyes says: When Muhammad Ali refused induction into the Army, he was widely quoted as saying, “No Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” This was a perfect marriage of anti-war and anti-racist sentiment. Better yet, it came straight from the mouth of a mega-celebrity thought to possess primitive folk wisdom. The only problem is that Ali never made this comment. “It’s wasn’t really his mind-set to say something in that way,” explained Ali biographer Thomas Hauser. “The companion thought of that comment is ‘people call me nigger in this country every day.’ I never heard Ali say ‘white people in this country call me nigger.’ He would attack racism. But he wouldn’t personalize it.” Despite extensive searching by himself and others, Hauser has never found the source of “no Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” He concluded that it was just one of those things that got picked up and passed around in the 60s. It was a comment we wanted Ali to make so badly that we made it for him.\"\n",

Once again, many Christians, mostly Serbs, fought in his army, including Kraljevic (the son of the king) Marko, the hero of another famous Epic, who died not in that battle, but in the Battle of Arges which Bayezid fought with the Wallachians on May 17, 1395. Mircea appears to have been victorious militarily, but his forces and resources were so depleted that he had to acknowledge the loss of the Dobrudja, into which Bayezid moved Turkish garrisons. He also had to accept the status of an Ottoman vassal and pay regular tribute. This arrangement lasted until the Danubian Principalities regained their independence. Although it created problems for the Romanians, it saved them from the much harsher treatment that went with direct Ottoman rule, especially during the centuries of decline.  \"\n",

The themes of 'Hamlet' are in 'Hamlet,' the same as the characters of 'Hamlet' are in 'Hamlet.'  It isn't complicated, the way some people try to make it.  And there is no \"\"original research\"\" in simply doing a theme summary, any more than there is \"\"original research\"\" in doing a character list.  Are you going to look at some book by Harold Bloom to find out whether Polonius is in the play, because otherwise you can't tell?  That would be nonsense, of course.  The same is true of the themes of the play.  The \"\"source\"\" for all the themes of 'Hamlet' is \"\"Hamlet.\"\"  That is a fact.  And I have no idea where people are getting their strange and eccentric ideas of what a \"\"theme\"\" is.  Some people who have posted here need to go to Merriam-Webster online, and look up the word \"\"theme.\"\"  A theme is a motif, a recurring idea.  That is factually what a \"\"theme\"\" is - look it up.  A final point, is it too much to ask that words should be spelled correctly in the article?  Look at what's there now  \"\"soliloquy\"\" is misspelled; \"\"cemetery\"\" is misspelled.  It looks terrible, and it's embarrassing.  Please, before you post something, just copy the text over to a text editor, and run a spelling check on it, since there doesn't seem to be a spell checker here.

I agree with the A7 deletion that took place when it did for both of these articles. I think the articles were written at a time when the criteria were more loosely defined and enforced, or people wrote these articles as unexperienced Wikipedians without knowing the criteria, quite possibly both. I think that means the articles need to be written correctly, not deleted, as they are notable in their own right.

      "Hanssen was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a family of mixed Danish-Polish and German descent. His father, a Chicago police officer, was emotionally abusive to Hanssen during his childhood.[7] Once, for no known reason, Howard Hanssen arranged for his son to fail a driver's test. In later life, Robert Hanssen speculated that his father had done this in order to 'toughen him up'. The elder Hanssen constantly disparaged his son and said that Robert would never make anything of his life.[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanssen graduated from William Howard Taft High School in 1962 and went on to attend Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1966. While at Knox, he took an interest in Russian through elective courses. It was also at this time when Hanssen applied for a cryptographer position in the NSA but was rebuffed due to budget setbacks. Originally set to become a doctor, Hanssen took the opportunity to enroll in the dental school at Northwestern University.[9] He did well academically, but said that he \"\"didn't like spit all that much\"\".[10] He switched his focus to business after three years,[11] and received an MBA in accounting and information systems in 1971. After graduating, he took a job with an accounting firm but quit to join the Chicago Police Department as an internal affairs investigator, specializing in forensic accounting. Hanssen left the department after two years, joining the FBI in January 1976.[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanssen met Bernadette \"\"Bonnie\"\" Wauck while he was attending dental school in Chicago. Bonnie was one of eight children from a staunchly Roman Catholic family. The couple married in 1968. After Hanssen married, he converted from Lutheranism to his wife's Catholicism, becoming a fervent believer and being extensively involved in Opus Dei.\n",
      "[edit] Early FBI career and first espionage activities (1979–1981)\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanssen joined the FBI as a special agent on 12 January 1976 and was transferred to the field office in Gary, Indiana. In 1978, Hanssen and his growing family (of three children and eventually six) moved to New York when the FBI transferred him to its field office there.[12] The next year, Hanssen was moved into counter-intelligence and given the task of compiling a database of Soviet intelligence for the Bureau. It was then, in 1979, only three years after joining the FBI, that Hanssen began his career as a Soviet, and later a Russian, spy.\n",
      "\n",
      "That year, Hanssen approached the GRU (the Soviet military intelligence agency) and offered his services. Hanssen never indicated any political or ideological motive for his activities, telling the FBI after he was caught that his only motivation was the money.[13] During his first espionage cycle, Hanssen told the GRU a significant amount, including information on FBI bugging activities and Bureau lists of suspected Soviet intelligence agents. His most important leak of information was the betrayal of Dmitri Polyakov, code named TOPHAT. Polyakov was a CIA informant for more than twenty years before his retirement in 1980, and passed enormous amounts of information to American intelligence while he rose to the rank of General in the Soviet Army. For unknown reasons, the Soviets did not act on their intelligence about Polyakov until he was betrayed a second time by CIA mole Aldrich Ames in 1985. Polyakov was arrested in 1986 and executed in 1988. Ames was officially blamed for giving Polyakov's name to the Soviets, but Hanssen's role remained unknown until after his arrest in 2001.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanssen was nearly exposed in 1981, when Bonnie Hanssen caught her husband in their basement writing a letter to the Soviets. Hanssen admitted to her that he'd been giving information to the Soviets (motivated purely by his \"\"need\"\" for money) and that he had received US$30,000 as payment, but he lied and said that he was only passing along false intelligence. Knowing this, Bonnie insisted that her husband go to confession, as is required in the Roman Catholic faith for those who have committed serious sins. The Opus Dei priest who allegedly heard Robert's confession is said to have told him to give the money to charity as an act of penance. This remains unconfirmed as under the Seal of Confession, “it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner for any reason\"\" (Canon 983.1) under penalty of \"\"latae sententiae excommunication” (Canon 1388.1). Hanssen told his wife that he gave the money to Mother Teresa, but it is unknown if he actually did so.[15] Hanssen then stopped spying for the Soviet Union until 1985.\n",

Some of it is an attempt to flush people out and try to understand what is happening.  I have made dozens of edits to to wikipedia over the years (usually not logged in) and I do try to improve it.  It's a great resource; we all know that.  I've had a very small percentage of my edits reverted over the years and it never bothered me.  To give a little history: I read the article and towards the bottom it mentions (2 sources, btw) how 2 Indians were shot, killed, and eaten.  I thought to myself, \"\"wow, that's pretty surprising; I had always heard that no one was murdered and they just ate people who had died naturally.  I should probably try to emphasize this so other people see it too without having to read down 30 paragraphs.\"\"  It seems to me that there is quite a difference between eating someone who's already dead, and killing someone to eat them.  Call me crazy.  Anyway, first I added a subheading and also put a mention in the opening paragraph.  I acknowledge that adding it to the opening paragraph was probably overkill, but doesn't this incident at least deserve its own sub-heading?  I challenge you to find the mention of the killings in the current article.  It is very difficult to find without reading the entire article.  And how many times in modern history have people in the USA been killed so they could be eaten?  I suggest to you that this is a noteworthy and highly unusual event.  Anyway, I will stop now.

However, wing flaps cause a significant contribution to drag during the climb-out and this explains why there is a limit to the amount of flap used during takeoff, and why pilots retract wing flaps as soon as they achieve the necessary airspeed.

We are forming guideslines etc, and while a look at the ones in place helped form them, I'll definitely admit that I could have overlooked stuff.

If the description were accurate, everyone would use it.  I have met or heard of not one person using it, which means there is some big flaw in the technique that if someone can find, be my guest to add it.\n",

That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective”.   I have said and I reiterate it here; “... As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora. The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics”.   In other words Æµ§œš1, there are ‘proponents of Ebonics’ and are ‘anti-proponents of Ebonics’.  The proponents of Ebonics are those who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   The 'anti-propronents of Ebonics' are those who do not use view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.  The parents of the children of African ancestry in the OUSD for which the OUSD Board passed the resolution in 1996 were parents who are ‘proponents of Ebonics’.  That is, they are parents who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   I have said and and I reiterate here;  “the OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) \"\"Ebonics\"\", (2) \"\"Pan African Communication Behaviors\"\" and/or (3) \"\"African Language Systems\"\".

I have said and I reiterate here, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English\"\" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric”.  I have said and I reiterate here, the other three views that Baugh posits as being the view of Afrocentric proponents of Ebonics, i.e., views  (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric.  Given that I did in fact include view number (iv) as an Afrocentric view I am at a loss to understand why you have excluded view number (iv) from what I have said concerning the OUSD resolution.   You should know that I'm suspicious of your having ommited view number (iv).  For view number (iv), i.e., the view that Ebonics “is the antonym of black English and is considered to be a language other than English\"\" (and thus a rejection of the notion of \"\"African American Vernacular English\"\" but nevertheless a term for what others term AAVE, viewed as an independent language and not a mere ethnolect)\"\" is what was expressly being supported in the OUSD resolution.    \n",

      "\n",
      "The IDF, according to its plan of withdrawal, started handing major positions in Lebanon over to the SLA in the middle of May 2000. The collapse started on May 22, 2000.  Around a dozen villages and eight SLA posts in the center of the front surrendered to Hezbollah. The posts were mostly manned by Shiite muslims who were put under heavy pressure by Hezbollah. Hezbollah had made pubic threats against those involved with the SLA in April 2000. The threats were most effective against the Shites in the SLA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antoine Lahad, the leader of the SLA was in Paris while all of this was going on. Lahad's departure for France at such a critical time was a source of demoralization within the SLA. Lahad has claimed that he was taking an extended family vacation in advance of the July departure of the IDF. He claims to not have been aware of the handover of IDF positions to the SLA in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of the day, the SLA front line had been cut in two with the flanks of the SLA positions in both the east and the west totally exposed to attack. On the morning of May 23, 2000, the western (Druze) sector of the front collapsed. There were (in 2000) reports of a secret deal between Walid Jumblatt and Hezbollah that led to the collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "This triggered off a general retreat of what remained of the SLA. Shortly after, both Israelis and some elements of the SLA were moving south. The retreat was finished by the early hours of May 24.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israeli initially announced that it would give labor visas good for one year to soldiers of the SLA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The controversy in all this is what the Israelis really intended to do in May. Many senior figures in the SLA claim that Israel announced the July departure date while actually planning a full withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000. These SLA people claim that Israel deliberately did not tell them the depature date because of fears the Lebanese could not be trusted with the information. I dont tend to believe these sorts of stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "My view is that the SLA collapsed out of its own internal weakness. The SLA was really multiple religious militias with no effective unified command to speak of. Hezbollah worked on breaking off the Shite and Druze elements of the SLA. The Shite portion cut a deal first. The Druze portion, seeing that the game was up closed their own deal after. Lahad probably knew what was going to happen and stayed far away.\n",
      "\n",

Much to my chagrin.   I have better (for real) things to do.    I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.

Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge.  The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some \"\"real Arab\"\" from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of \"\"al-Qushayri\"\" roots is unverifiable.  The most authoritative of the Hadiths is al-Bukhari (from the city of Bukhara).  Having read what you wrote for me, I have reason to believe that someone like you is out of touch with reality and I am not even going to accept an edit war with someone like you. So I let you be happy by deleting the \"\"forced\"\" out of the article, and stay happy with your romanticism and keep thinking that Shahrbanoo indeed chose Husayn and they \"\"lived happily ever after!\"\", and both Ali and Muhammad knew Persian, and \"\"Shahrbanoo realized that they had special knowledge\"\"!! hehe no wonder your nation is the way it is today, their \"\"educated\"\" people are like you, I can imagine what the uneducated ones are like!!  -)   22:15, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)\"\n",

      "Wikipedia has its own guidance for notability that may not be the same as your intuitive sense of what is notable. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia of general knowledge rather than an index of profiles of companies and people. Each article needs several independent reliable sources to show significant impact on the historical record. The guidance for organizations is given at WP:ORG and for biographies WP:BIO applies.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the articles you are creating have reliable sources to support the criteria defined in that guidance then you may have a reason to keep the articles from being deleted which you are welcome to raise on the article talk page or on any linked deletion discussion. If you are associated with the organization, person or product the article is about then you must follow the conflict of interest guidelines and avoid editing the article yourself but you are free to suggest and discuss changes.\n",

      "\n",
      "As I recall, Napier forms a rebel group known as the \"\"Soldiers of Liberty,\"\" but to maintain their cover, they only speak the initials of the organization.  I don't recall if we're told the Amtorian word for \"\"soldier,\"\" but we do know that in their universal language, plurals are formed by adding a prefix, either \"\"kloo-\"\" or \"\"kl-\"\" depending upon whether the root word begins with a consonant or a vowel.  We do learn that the Amtorian for \"\"of\"\" is \"\"kum.\"\"  Therefore, \"\"liberty\"\" must either be a plural concept, or must begin with a \"\"k\"\" anyawy.  So, the group is named the \"\"Kl-something kum K-something,\"\" initials K-K-K!  We're told that's spoken kung-kung-kung on Venus rather than kay-kay-kay, by the kay ... er, way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait a minute, on this basis, wouldn't just about every Amtorian organization have at least two K's in their initials? Wouldn't the K-K-K get confused with the K-K-P and the K-K-S-K and all the others.?  Hell of a way to carry on covert operations.  Sounds like that Monty Python bit about the Judean People's Front versus the People's Front of Judea and the other splitters.  (\"\"What!  You're from the kung-kung-kung!  How dare you?\"\"  \"\"No, I said kung-kung-bung!\"\")\n",

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time.

Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Those dialects became known as \"\"Languages\"\" after diversification. Ishmael with his mother moved to the Arabic concentrated area. Ishmael learned Arabic and married an Arab girl. He begot Arab children from their mothers side. Those children again married Arab. This continued until those children became a big tribe called Quraysh or Quraish, reknowed for the perfection of their dialect of Arabic & for being a strong and honored tribe among the Arabs. Their DNA would have been diluted nearly completely by the Arab tribe Ishmael joined. But as we know the Y chromasome is passed down by the father. Hence it is relavent to state that Quraysh's male population would have had a great affinity geneticly to Ishmael, the non-Arab. Yet Maternaly they would have had a greater affinity to the other Arab tribes. by BB\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Overview:\n",
      "Presently, ACORN is under FBI investigation for massive voter fraud and other serious  crimes in connection to the 2008 presidential election directly concerning Barack Obama  who was one of its principles. It's a matter we take very seriously,\"\" FBI spokeswoman  Bridget Patton told the Associated Press. \"\"It is against the law to register someone to  vote who does not fall within the parameters to vote, or to put someone on there  falsely.\"\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Acorn is the largest of a plethora of radical left wing groups with more than 1,200  neighborhood chapters in 110 cities across the country with a national budget of $37  million who's sole purpose was to suddenly prior to the election spring into action  after quietly building up over the years to gerrymander the 2008 presidential election  through massive voter fraud. However, they claim to be nonpartisan but are radically  left wing with actual communist memberships. Most of their funding comes from U.S.  government grants. Further, to that end their intentions were to bring in and harbor  hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens from various countries and placing them in HUD  public housing and \"\"choice\"\" voucher programs awarding free houses to illegal aliens at  taxpayer expense while wantonly neglecting the disabled who desperately needed housing  thereto. This was coerced into action through legal threats to these agencies citing  civil rights laws. \n",
      "\n",
      "Through these intimidations, using civil rights laws it further precipitated first the  collapse of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when these impossible  mortgages collapsed in the fall of 2008 along with the other forced \"\"minority\"\" bad loans  at HUD which led to the collapse of the mortgage industry starting a domino effect that  led to the failing of all top five investment banks on wall street and the mess we are  in today in February 2009. The government initiated \"\"bailouts\"\" (really government  theft) and gifted itself nearly ten trillion dollars in \"\"stimulus packages\"\" as an  excuse to fix this smaller two hundred billion dollar bad mortgage problem. Most of  this on debt to China who has precipitated this by pegging the dollar and implementing  grossly unfair trade practices initiating monstrous trade deficits and debt we will  never rise above. Although President George Bush(R) played his share in ridiculous  deregulation, ACORN with backing from Barney Frank(D) the chairman of the House  Financial Services Committee which oversees housing and banking industries really  initiated the whole debacle by forcing these ridiculous minority loans.  \n",

      "The case details: \n",
      "95% of polled U.S. citizens object to illegal immigration and open boarders.  Nonetheles, Maricopa County Arizona is a microcosm, analogues to how the influx of  illegal and legal immigration is causing huge population increases raising serious  questions about their rising undue influence upon our elections, particularly the  election of Barack Obama of late and the fairness, legality and constitutionality  thereof as assessed by CNN and announced by prime-time television CNN anchor Lou Dobbs  upon his analysis of the latest census figures ramifications. Such is the case because  in Maricopa County, much like other counties in the United States population not  citizenship determines voting districts. And there's clear, mounting evidence that  both illegal and legal aliens are replacing long time residence and partisans using  people that can't vote as \"\"filler people\"\" to fill up the extra people needed to make up  a given district along with the people that favor their political party. Such is  particularly the case because the census figures don't distinguish the difference  between legal and illegal aliens and most of the illegals are coming across the border  from Mexico who is actively investing in and interfering in our electoral process.  v=8oTQoZifckU&feature;=related \n",

      "Okay, I'm back from my latest 24-hour persecution, and I realize how the mediation request merely subjected the article to more \"\"Thought police\"\" rather than encouraging civilized solutions to problems.  My mind is spinning in 100 directions. I really dread any continued judgment by a \"\"jury of sneers\"\" so I doubt I would participate in any forums of that type. Some articles become hopeless chaos, when the masses descend and start hacking with no concept of the topic (\"\"Harry Potter what?\"\"). One of the worst hatchet jobs, to any article, was with \"\"Search engine\"\" where the technical details conflicted with the general concept of searching for \"\"stuff\"\" and people kept deleting those excessive technical parts about ranking pages (not unlike avoiding text about Low copy number DNA, fingerprints, or luminol of Italian fruit juice). It was another case of \"\"too many kooks spoil the broth\"\" and hence, that implies a long-term issue: articles need a limited \"\"roster of active editors\"\" to limit meddling, perhaps have an active count, and when a editor abandons an article, then space opens for another editor to join the roster. The current myth that 500 people can be allowed (to \"\"adjust\"\" an article) is what led to the \"\"Search engine\"\" article becoming a wasteland of chaotic text. Again, it boils down to how should a person choose which articles to develop, versus when they are wasting their expertise in mud-pit articles. It might be much better to develop 100 rarely-trampled articles, rather than fight a POV-stampede within a single article. Plus, it is unsettling to realize they're reading every word of your talk-page and plotting the next insult.

This is actually the problem that cladists think is connected to the Linnean systematization, and try to solve with cladistics. However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space. The problem (i.e., ambiguity) is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible. The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with: yes. There is no way to escape this ambiguity. Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  ]\n",

At one point, with about a half dozen edits, you added 24 ships to the section \"\"Ready Reserve Force ships\"\". You listed them all as belonging to the Cape Ducato class, however that is a class of only 5 ships. I'm wondering if you had other info that stated these other 19 ships were considered a part of that class? If not, then if you have some free time, would mind stopping by the article and help correct this? From what I've (briefly) read, most of these ships are from various sources, builders and countires.

I knwo this list has been kept short by agreement way back, so i'm putting this topic here to allow people to discuss which prophets should be listed, if any, and how many.  I believe there's a more comprehensive list elsewhere in the Baha'i articles which mention Hud, the prophet to the Sabeans, Noah, etc. all prophets that would have to go into a full list of \"\"prophets accepted by Baha'is\"\".

      "Well, I am very displeased with this article and with wikipedia for not wishing to ensure that all sides of the issue be reported on this sensitive topic.  The integrity of this article is only about a 50 out of 100. I too have added information to the introduction of this article lending mere existance to the fact that global warming is still disputed by some, and it too has dissappeared or was even removed by wikipedia.  I believe that enough discussion has occurred here, as per their request, to warrant that tiny tidbit of informaton being sited fairly in the INTRODUCTION of this article, alongside the rant in the INTRODUCTION that argues for global warming.  If Wikipedia cannot do something so simple and fair and chooses to support silencing those whose views are contrary to their own, as a supposedly fair, balanced, and factual encyclopedia, I will have to boycott further use of this resource, because it's no resource when the information in it is purposefully skewed and where the encyclopedia takes actions that blatently support the skewing of information and the omission of facts.  Wikipedia monitors this article has has repeatedly removed such additions that alter the single-sided position of this article, for one my own addition.  Therefore, wikipedia, I request once again that this information be added and it's evidence for that sited, WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND WITHOUT DEMEANING LANGUAGE, in this article, as this is only fair and factual.  My previous changes are on file and I would not mind them being replaced.  The controversary section isn't enough because it's language is clearly demeaning to any idea that does not support global warming and the introduction starts out stating it as a fact without lending weight to other views.  I don't have a problem with calling global warming a fact, I simply want it stated that it is a fact that many people still dissagree and have good evidence to support that idea.  Just because Al Gore thinks we're headed for death doesn't make it so, as was pointed out in the last post here that just because a leader says that everyone agrees with him doesn't make it true.  I remind you that plenty of action groups, left wing radical groups and individuals, non-existant scientists, and other disreputable groups and people have also supported global warming, and therefore, I want to state for the record that just because an oil tycoon signs against global warming doesn't mean everyone who does isn't credible.  You never hear about the 10s of thousands of scientists that dispute it, but 1 that agrees with GW, he makes the front page.  Anyway, I come down hardest on wikipedia because they're the host of this article and it is their responsibility to make sure its' integrity is maintained, and there they have failed in my opinion.

So I concur with Vartan, and any neutral user can't do otherwise when De Waal has been used more than his notability would allow as sole source in countless articles. As he is a sole source, he can therefore be considered as having fringe position and removed unless Grandmaster or Atabek have any other works substantiating the personal opinions of De Waal who supports fringe positions in various issues including Shushi or the Armenian Genocide. The fact that he presents the Armenian Genocide as an Armenian position and compares it to a fabrication of the 60s of an alleged 2.5 million Azeri exterminated by Armenians alone would be enough to dismiss his position for that particular period of history. I'm afraid this time around, the adding of De Waal has reached the limit.

      "Hello, Max, this is indef-blocked User:Doughnuthead speaking. I firmly believe I can finally be of positive use to Wikipedia, and I no longer feel the need to gain attention through malicious editing. I'd actually all but forgotten about all the nonsense i had caused in the previous years until i saw a funny picture online of a guy with a swollen head, which reminded me of my username. But more to the point, i realised that my ability to edit the talk page was barred. After taking a look at previous edits, i realised i was being a bit of a tube. You were right to take that ability away. So just a heads up that i can only edit on anon as this account is obviously still suspended. In terms of getting unblocked, i haven't made a single edit to Wikipedia in almost 3 years, and during this time i have matured enough to the point that i look back at what i was getting up to and think 'Oh god! Who was i even trying to impress?!' In terms of where i aim to get involved in on the website, I still hold a strong interest in football (soccer) related articles, along with hip-hop and old school rock related articles- hence my music taste. As it has been so long since I bothered to use the editing facility, I'll need re-shown how to work various parts of the site or whatever it's called. I only remembered how to request unblock by clicking on the 'edit' tab and noticing one of my old templates! Furthermore, I don't intend to be an overly active user on the site, as I begin my university course in September much of my time will be dedicated towards my studies, and so I intend to see Wikipedia as a hobby to input my thoughts and research every now and then. Finally, thank you very much for reading my request - I appreciate the time taken to do so and I apologise for my past behaviour. I was just a stupid kid (it lasted from age 12-15 if I recall!) and I hope to hear from you as soon as possible. If you're wondering how I came across you, you were involved in my ban years ago.89.241.208.230\n",

And as I've tried to explain before, in the West, particularly in the U.S., people do think in ethnic terms, about Europe anyway. Königsberg a) always was ethnically German, and b) never was de jure part of Poland, i.e. Poland proper. Although the (German) dukes of Prussia were obliged to render homage to the Polish monach for 150 years or so, this was a result of the defeat of the Teutonic Order and its aftermath, not a symptom of Königsberg's ethnicity, which remained German until 1945-46, when Königsberg as such ceased to exist.\n",

In general it has been decided that this is a small enough price to pay for the good that the bot does in rapidly reverting the rest that are indeed vandalism.  In general the bot is supposed to run in Friendly mode, where it will not edit war.  This means that if you get hit by a false positive, just make the edit again and remove the warning from your talk page.  The bot should not revert a second time on the same edit.\n",
      " As for refining, that's tricky.  What was there about those two edits that a bot, a computer program, could have used to identify them as not vandalism?  Sure, the bot could be programmed with the very specific examples of those two edits, but the next time won't be exactly the same.  If we told it that \"\"CITATION NEEDED\"\" was not vandalism, then the next time they used \"\"NEED CITATION\"\", or \"\"CITATION REQUIRED\"\" or \"\"FACT CHECK\"\", then the bot would not catch it.  We cannot anticipate every single way someone might make this mistake.  The radio station edit is even more tricky.  And what about the edits that have nothing to do with citations or radio stations?  We would need solid criteria that would allow the bot to tell that one all-cap edit is vandalism while another is not.  And I for one have no idea what we could use.  New ideas for improving the bot are welcome, but in this case we need very specific ideas for rules that will help a bot tell the difference.  The bot is stupid, and only does what it is programmed to do, nothing more.  It cannot make judgement calls edit by edit. -  \"\n",

      "1. Rupert Thorne was a recurring villain in a Kingpin fashion from the 2nd half of the 70's until the Crisis came. Then he was forgotten and then saved by Timm in the 90's for the animated series. Falcone is just a recurring name Frank Miller and Jeph Loeb use when he needs to mention Gotham City mafia. Carmine, was never a lead villain like Rupert has been. If you accuse me of just watching the animated series (which I deny) I can acuse you of just getting exited because of the Carmine appearance in the last movie. Maroni is just a support guy for Two-Face's story, as Tony Zucco is for Robin's (who is the nerd defending minor characters and bragging about how he knows nick names everybody knows, like \"\"Boss\"\" and \"\"roman\"\" , now? heh, heh, heh)\n",

Just check how many batman titles are published every single month and how many people buys against any other superhero's books. You will learn that monthly, the amount of baman books sold is good enough to call the mythos appealing. That's why there are 6 motion pictures, 2 animated series (without jl and superfriends and even scooby-doo appearances by joker, riddler, scarecrow and penguin) and, live action show and several internet about batman, his foes and his mythos. That's why the mythos is so appealing.\n",

Being a killer doesn’t make an enemy notable as his protagonism and his importance in the mind of Batman and Batman readers, writers and creators does. Knowing Batman's identity and not being completely on the good side makes her even more important. You seem new to the comics’ world, do you really think Catwoman is going to be Holly for so long? Context, PC, context. Selina has been a main character for more than 60 years, I’m talking about all those years. Not about the comic book you just bought on the corner store last week, my \"\"mate\"\". Following again your line of thought, it not worth saying Nixon was a president because he is dead.

In batman comics bets are that, if you buy a batman comic from any year at random, or watch any episode form any batman series, also at random, The Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, the Riddler or Two-face are going to be the main villain. If you get the croc, or scar-face, the mad-hatter you are loki, and if you catch you hero the \"\"Roman\"\" you are really, really a lottery winner. By the way there it’s something called figurative speech, and it means to compare situations, I dunno if they told you. They are not literary on a race.\n",

Those characters are useful tools when a writer wants to analyze Batman. Besides, I don't know if you are capable of using your imagination, I’m sure you can, it’s an indispensable tool for getting into the story when you read, but if someone messes with your mind on the level they have messed with Batman’s , that'll probably leave some ugly emotional scars on you... good thing he is the Batman. Therefore, they do get to be influential in a way. Thinking they don't get to appear as much as the five previous, therefore they are not influential is just wrong\n",

As far as I can see the word 'flapper' was originally British slang and from another origin, but it's possible that when the word spread to America folk etymology quickly came up with an explanation for it connected with the fashion for wearing galoshes unbuckled.  This association must have happened early on, as the 1928 film 'Bare Knees' mentioned above seems already to reflect it. Could you add some dates to your anecdote, and tell us roughly when your grandmother was wearing this fashion?

      "The fact that there don't appear to be any, of course!!! For the sake of the argument, let me outline why I consider the story to be incredible (though not necessarily false). 1. Why were his parents permitted to have sex? 2. Why was he not aborted like other babies? 3. Why was he kept alive? Children are not cost-effective as slaves in the early years. 4. Why was he kept in the camp when he could have been transferred to an \"\"orphanage\"\"?  5. If he was dishonest about his mother's death, how can his honesty on anything else be assumed? 6. How could they afford to maintain an electric fence when they couldn't afford to feed border guards? 7. Why was a military uniform a \"\"passport\"\" to travel through the country, when military service is compulsory? What did Shin do when questioned about his unit or purpose given his ignorance of the DPRK? 8. How was Shin able to trade, travel, survive, and escape better than the average North Korean given his ignorance? 9. Why would a hungry border guard let him through in exchange for food and cigarettes, when the guard could capture him, pocket the food and cigarettes, and gain a reward for capturing a traitor and prison escapee? 10. Given the long and largely unguarded border, why would he need to deal with a guard at all? 11. Finally, given that, by his own admission, he has next to no experience of North Korea, outside bizarre prison experience, how can it be established that he has ever been to North Korea, and is not an ethnic Korean from China?\n",
      "I am sure that the book makes an attempt to explain some of these issues, but this is circular logic.

Malleus does not conform to the fourth pillar.  One must conform to all five pillars to be a Wikipedian; that is the social conract.  While my earlier thoughts had been running along the lines of one must endorse all the pillars, that puts an emphasis on belief rather than conduct. \n",

Betacommand is not an unperson.  Will Beback is not an unperson.  I would argue that my statement could be equally applied to any of them or other banned users for a similar reason: each of them failed to uphold the fourth pillar, although in a variety of ways and intensities, and was banned for that.  Malleus has the distinction of being the most prolific content creator being up for a ban in my memory.  The content he has created has is not in question, and he has had an admirable pattern of contribution to the encyclopedia... but that's not sufficient.  Much like Betacommand, Malleus has been shown repeatedly that his style of interaction is insufficient, and he has chosen to continue it. No one has proposed that Malleus' contributions be erased, that his name be stricken from anywhere or anything.

      " Hello.  Thanks.  First, if you want to chat with me, please reply at my Talk Page - not at yours.  I check my Talk Page every day and see the new postings.  I certainly do not check your Talk Page every day to see if you posted anything there.  My Talk Page is at this link here > User talk:Joseph A. Spadaro.  Second, per Wikipedia rules, I am not giving any legal advice at all, just trying to answer a semantics question.  Third, remember that the situation and laws are different all over the place.  I am in the USA and answering as such ... I have no idea where you are located, and if it is within or outside the USA.  So, all of that being said ... I can now answer your latest follow-up questions.  Let me address the first part of your question, which states: \"\"one is free to terminate such a contract for whatever reasons are permitted or not forbidden within that contract.\"\"  In a one word answer, yes.  But, the way that your follow-up question is worded, it seems like you are mixing apples and oranges  that is, confusing very different things.  I guess I am not sure what you mean by \"\"terminating\"\" a contract?  The contract itself usually has dates within it, such as \"\"This contract runs from January 1, 2008, and will expire on December 31, 2008.\"\"  So, you never \"\"terminate\"\" that contract  it just \"\"dies\"\" on December 31, 2008.  If you want to \"\"break\"\" (\"\"stop\"\") the contract before the ending date of December 31, that's a different story - and it would depend on why (what reasons) you want to not finish out the whole year-contract.  As you refer to, some contracts will have explicit terms within them that delineate when/where/how/why the contract may be terminated.  Some contracts have no dates in them, correct.  And, within them, there will be (there should be) certain reasons as to when / how / why either party may \"\"end\"\" the contract.  But, in a one-word simplistic answer ... yes, one is free to terminate such a contract for whatever reasons are permitted or not forbidden within that contract.  Let me address the second part of your question, which states: \"\"one cannot legitimately accuse the contractee of 'insubordination' ...\"\"  Again, you are mixing apples and oranges.  So, it is a hard question to answer.  In a simple answer, the answer is ... maybe yes and maybe no.  If any terms of the contract deal with \"\"insubordination\"\", then - yes, one party may certainly accuse the other party of insubordination.  For example, a contract may state: \"\"If Party A does not report to the work site prior to 9 AM, that will be considered insubordination\"\" ... or \"\"If Party B does not submit the appropriate paper work at the end of the day, that action will be considered insubordination\"\" ... or something like that.  So, if the terms of the contract deal with insubordination, then - yes, one party may certainly accuse the other of insubordination.  Now, let's say that the contract does not in any way mention insubordination.  (This is probably the likely case that you are referring to.)  Then, in terms of semantics (that is, language and wording) ... then, no  one party may not accuse the other of insubordination.  But, really, they can accuse the other party of breaching the terms of the contract ... that is, not meeting up with their end of the bargain in the contract.  So, the real and correct words (semantics) would be that one party accuses the other of either: breaching (breaking) the contract ... or ... not complying with the terms and consitions of the contract ... or words like that.  Those essentially mean the same thing as the concept of insubordination (not doing what you are supposed to do and expected to do, when asked to do so).  But, you just would not use the word insubordination.  You would use the word \"\"violating our contract\"\".  But, in spirit, it all means the same thing.  So, if I was the party to the contract .... and the other party accused me of \"\"insubordination\"\" ... and our contract terms never mention insubordination ... then, I would take that to mean that the other party is accusing me of not adhering to the terms of the contract and he is simply using the wrong jargon ... but he may (or may not) be wrong in principal and substance.  In other words, just because the other party used the wrong/incorrect word (he improperly used the incorrect word of insubordination), that doesn't change the fact that maybe, yes, I did do something wrong and I did go against the contract.  I hope this all helps.  Please reply at my Talk Page.  Maybe if you make your question a little more clearer and detailed, I can craft a better answer.  Thanks.  (  )\"\n",

      "The first question you need to ask yourself is, \"\"do I have a history (perhaps as yet unadmitted) of being overly critical of myself?\"\" If the answer to this might be yes, then you can't always trust your own tendency to self-criticize, because your subconscious motivation is not self-improvement but self-denigration; don't pay that too much heed then. If, however, the answer is no, then if you notice a behavior of yours that bothers you, listen to the notice, and decide cognitively how much it really bothers you or should bother you. Sometimes we only notice what bugs us about ourselves by trying to observe ourselves objectively. You might be doing that, and you might do well to listen, but it's hard for me to weigh this. As for my own opinion, looking at Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 December 11#Abortion, you haven't added anything that was redundant, so I wouldn't say it's an issue. If the discussion gets long and people keep bringing up things that you've already answered, remember that the closing admin is going to read everything and they should notice if you've already answered a repeated objection. Then it's a question of how much faith you have in the admins (I know, I'm treading on very thin ice now). For instance, I made sure to answer everything at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Faith Freedom International because I wanted to be absolutely certain that if the article did get deleted, I couldn't blame myself for not trying everything. I'm likely to do the same thing at Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 December 5#Ali Sina if anyone opposes the citations I've dug up. But my motivation here is dedication to freedom of speech and for less critical articles I leave my comments for the admin and let it go. A rule of thumb that you should know is that if an article is up for deletion and 80% of the votes are keep, it will probably be kept (even though it's \"\"not a vote\"\"). If it's less than 80%, then the keepers will have to put forward a pretty solid argument to keep. As you can see at the Faith Freedom AfD, keepers had about 66% and we just barely came through with \"\"no consensus\"\". I suspect that the factors that weighed most heavily for the admin were TruthSpreader's and my arguements, as almost no one else seriously argued the merits of the citations and notability guidelines.\n",

      "No flaming intended, I just want balance to come to this subject.  Explain to the world, how putting Greek homosexuals on a pedestal, is in any way, shape, or form, NPOV.  You know, Greek scholars on the matter paint homosexuality in a different hue than outsiders who romanticize the subject (e.g. Oliver Stone's Alexander (film)).  They see homosexuality as existing all over the world and in all eras.  To portray Ancient Greece as some buggery paradise is prejudiced and ignorant, just as if they were all claimed to be paragons of heterosexual machismo.  Gay Greeks are your Wandering Jew.  Whenever I watched Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, homosexuality did not come to mind.  Perhaps the slash fiction community would rather Hercules and Xena \"\"get nasty\"\" with their traveling companions, but that's beside the point.  You can't always have it to your fantasy or ideal, simply by calling other people \"\"narrow\"\".  So far, you've succeeded in stereotyping Greeks as rabid homosexuals.  Out of all the characteristics of the Hellenic people, founders of Europe, you had to claim that their homosexuals were most importanteven iconic representations of the West.  Nobody said they were all straight either, which is something you have to admit.  Homosexual revisionism is not fact.   \"\n",

But no one has come out and judged that the autopsy report is right and Cheshire is wrong, so we cannot report that. Since Cheshire and Thogmartin are both doctors, we can't dismiss one out of hand over the other. They both qualify as \"\"expert testimony\"\".

As it is now, Cheshire says Terri watched him, and then parenthesis point out the autopsy two weeks later says something different. So, the conflicting facts are present next to each other.

As a matter of fact, they sound rather odd to most native speakers and would hardly ever be encountered in the media. Without conducting a scientific survey, I would say that x and χ for initial /r/ and intervocalic /rr/ are restricted to poorly educated speakers from the city of Rio de Janeiro and its surroundings, while the media and all reasonably educated speakers there are actually notorious for their use of [ʁ].

Why is it kosher to count neutral votes as opposes? Perhaps I misunderstand the point of a neutral vote, but it seems to me you have chosen to count a nominally neutral voter's comments as a de facto oppose vote. Wouldn't those who voted neutral (i.e., no opinion one way or the other) have voted to oppose if that's what they'd intended? This strikes me as being tantamount to coöpting votes, and given that the difference between discarding the neutrals and counting them as opposes is the difference between 68% and 75% support, I would like to better understand this aspect of the consensus doctrine.

The subspace that includes all dimensions is the Universe itself. The Universe itself is a subspace that includes all dimensions.\n",

Without such a thing, then the Universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist; there can still be God as a supreme being of the Universe in such a condition, but God's energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy.\n",
      " 6. God is smart, is intelligent, is wise, has knowledge, is a creator, is good, is benevolent, has mercy, and has understanding. God has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the Universe.\n",
      " 7. God expects God's creation to do well, since as a creator, then the Universe was created for God's purpose and enjoyment; therefore, life elements of God's creation, such as people, are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom, understanding, and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good.\n",
      " 8. Because God is supreme, then Heaven and its rules of existence are defined by God.\n",
      " 9. God not only deals with people of Earth of our Sol system of the Milky Way galaxy, God is a supreme being that can interact with the entire Universe in whole, or God can interact with the Universe in part; therefore, God truly understands some of the issues and survival strategies of life, and this implies that God may be truly forgiving and God may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important.\n",
      " 10. It is always believed that God likes people, so help from God can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer.\n",
      " 11. God likes to be acknowledged from God's own creation, so it is good to acknowledge God as the benevolent intelligent creator of the Universe.\n",
      " 12. Love God. Love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society, family, nation, benevolence, and many good things of life. Be who you are as a person and love God, and God is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people.\n",

      "God has created the Universe and has the ability to define Heaven in any way. Each person can get a personal Heaven, or Heaven may be a interaction for people, or Heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people. Heaven is always defined as a good place; but, a personal Heaven can also be a personal Hell tailored to your life, attitude, and existence where God could give us, by observation, an environment where the individual prospered. The personal Heaven and Hell would be much like an metaphorical ant farm that is designed for ants, but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm, and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive, and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy (visit a zoo and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailored to the different animal species).\n",

It was a 27.3 m (89.5 ft) female caught off the South Shetland Islands in January 1925. Whether it was measured or not I can't say. It wasn't measured by a scientist in the standard zoological manner (in a straight line from the tip of the rostrum to the notch of the flukes) though, so it probably wasn't measured accurately (if at all). It was most likely measured alongside a factory ship during flensing (unless it was taken to the Deception Island station). This was just before the widespread use of stern slipways, so it would have been difficult to measure if it indeed was. The cited source should be Mackintosh and Wheeler (1929), which cite Risting (1928), which I don't have access to. Mackintosh and Wheeler simply say it was \"\"27.3 m. or 89 ft. 6 in.\"\" (p. 321).

Local government is pretty big in California, and there is no mention of special districts anywhere in the article. Third, capital punishment is given more detail than any branch of the government. That's POV pushing. Capital punishment is just one aspect of the law. If we are going to keep it, we should seriously consider adding in other criminal law aspects.

      "\"\"...During World War II, many amateur radio operators became military communicators and became familiar with Teletype systems, especially Radio Teletype. After the war, AT&T; persuaded the military to disable each of the massive number of Model 15s which came onto the surplus market by removing several key components from each unit. Radio hams were permitted to buy replacements for these parts (or complete machines from AT&T; or Bell) only after presenting proof of their licenses and signing a contract which stated that the machines would never be used in commercial service, and would not be sold to anyone who had not also signed the contract. This was to prevent the creation of a communications network to rival that of the Bell TWX system...\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a few questions about your update to the teleprinter article as I have not been able to find references to a couple of the points that you list.  First, are you sure that model 15 machines were released from the military?  All references that I've seen note that model 26 machines, that look similar, were released after World War II.  Second, can you reference a source for your information related to parts being removed from machines. In my experience, machines were partially smashed not partially disassembled to prevent future commercial use. Finally,would you agree that your reference to the AT&T; TWX system is too limiting as it mentions a single commercial use.  Rather than pointing out one commercial use for surplus teleprinter equipment, it is probably better to simply state something similar to \"\"...teleprinters were available to amateur radio operators from a number of commercial sources on condition that they were used for purely amateur radio purposes and would not be resold for commercial use...\"\"\n",

I would suggest waiting for a bit, as the article still seems pretty choppy to me. I took a stab at the navigation section tonight, rearranging sentences for paragraph flow, but didn't get very far without doing additional research. The article is comprehensive and duly referenced but I think it's still missing the elegant narrative that characterizes a feature article (\"\"prose is engaging, even brilliant, and of professional standard\"\"). Because it's been written by so many editors over many years, it feels a bit pieced together, and I think we have some work to do in creating an engaging narrative about the river. Missing citations, etc., are something we can deal with during the FA review, but I think it may help to work on the general flow of the article before going up for FA. I'll help out as I can...   \n",

It states that Iberian Languages (as the languages from the Iberian Peninsula and spoken there as well) are distributed in the mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula, spoken in Spain and France. This creates the impression that France belongs to the Iberian Peninsula whihch wrong, the only lands that form the Iberian Peninsula are: Portugal, Spain, Andorra and Gibraltar. Once again, France does not belong to the Iberian Peninsula. It might have influence of the Iberian Languages, since French is also spoken in Andorra, and is very similar to the dominant official languages (in the Peninsula Iberica) Portuguese and Spanish.

They say they think they can change people from having homosexual attraction in way that minimise this, or even have heterosexual attraction.  The APA has said quite categorically that there is no evidence to support claims like these.  I don't see that people's delusions, even if they are experts, need a place in the lead of an article in which they only feature marginally.  They feature marginally, because the therapy is seen as fringe by the mainstream psychological and psychiatric communities.  The only people who take it seriously usually do so from a religious perspective, and the APA has also stated that religious interests have no expertise on these matters, and should stick to religion.  It is a fringe theory, because very few practitioners in this area hold it as having any merit, and there is no evidence to support it.

Adding is far less likely to step on toes than subtracting. Other editors will judge the quality of your work and you'll gain acceptance as one of the team. Then when you've established your credibility, try re-organising existing material - amalgamate material that deals with the same subject but might appear in different sections, shorten paragraphs and improve syntax, and so on - but always trying not to delete more than is essential, and trying also to retain wikilinks. Finally, suggest deletion of any material you think is irrelevant or otherwise doesn't belong - this is where you'll probably find you have to compromise the most.

She also often dreamt a huge and well built guy with fire on his body almost look like Vajrapani was appeared and talked to her without any frightening. She also dreamt a white clothed young guy came and told her to go with him on riding dragon and hovered in the sky several times. And often that guy comes in her dream and told to keep that white rabbit and feed well. On the forth night of Rinpoche’s birthday, she dreamt same. After gave birth of of Rinpoche, Dhardo Rinpoche named him “Lhundub”.\n",

Rinpoche still remember that dream he told to his mother several times.\n",

In the winter of that year, the boy Rinpoche and his parents and grandparents visited to Bodhagaya, where he got the full discourse of Shantideva’s Bodhisatvacharyavatara from His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. While in Bodhgaya, Rinpoche’s parents were visited Pangnang Rinpoche whom they asked soothing of little boy’s well beings. Pangnang Rinpoche, after drawing of dice for soothing told that nothing to worry and added name “Tsondue” after his name “Lhundup”. There after the little boy was called “Lhundub Tsondue”.\n",

After two years later his admittance to Lhopa Khangtsen in Sera Jey Monastic University in south India, the eight-year-old Lhundub Tsondue was invited by Geshe Jampa Topgyal and Geshe Gyaltsen of Lhopa Khangtsen in 1986. The first hair cutting ceremony was taken by Sera Jey Khensur Ngawang Legden and given name as “Ngawang Choekyi Gyaltsen” and admitted to the monastery.\n",
