      "I've undone your revert on the intro to this article, because although it's in good faith, I think it's mistaken. The reason you gave was that the information is elsewhere in the article, which is already long, so the intro shouldn't cover it even in summary, as it's in the main body under \"\"History\"\". Although I respect your intent of keeping it concise and avoiding redundancy, the Manual of Style for the intro is quite clear:\n",
      " The lead serves as an introduction to the article and a summary of its most important aspects ... [It] should be able to stand alone as a concise overview. It should define the topic, establish context, explain why the topic is notable, and summarize the most important points, including any prominent controversies ... The lead is the first part of the article most people read, and many only read the lead.\n",

      "The issue here is that the intro currently says that state bans were declared unlawful in 2015, 38+ states provided some rights as from 2003, and Windsor gave federal rights in 2013. There needs to be some mention of the backdrop and prior controversies as they were huge, and an increase from 2 to 3 paras to add substance on the background + context is (in my view) appropriate: even very long articles still need a proper introduction that summarizes their contents. Take a look at African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–68) for an example of the intro to a long-ish article. \n",

      "\n",
      "I have an issue with the statment \"\"Beckett's work is . . . deeply pessimistic about the human condition\"\" as found in the first paragraph. I changed \"\"deeply\"\" to \"\"deceptively,\"\" and it was immediately changed back. I don't know how to contact the subsequent editor directly, so I'll post this here by way of discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps replacing “deeply” with “deceptively” is not the best fix, but as it stands the quoted statement puts forth, as fact, an opinion that is widley open to interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beckett’s writings aren’t just about the journey. If they were, “deeply pessimistic” would be nearly undebatable. They’re just as much about the destination, or at least the goal. And while he frames life’s journey as a slog through shit, his ultimate implication is that the slog is worthwhile. As everything from the Greek and Latin classics to the greatest of Hollywood’s pro-war propaganda movies have proven again and again, the more monstrously you portray the obstacle, the larger looms the hero who overcomes them. The same is true in Beckett: the obstacles are unrelenting and nearly insurmountable, but the journey continues, heroically. The Beckett hero may be standing in the dark, but he's faced towards the light, distant—an unattainable—as it may be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The essential Beckett quote isn’t “I can’t go on”—full stop; it’s “I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I may not have convinced you, personally, that Beckett’s work is more optimistic than pessimistic. But perhaps I’ve made a case that a flatly factual statement like “Beckett's work is stark . . . and deeply pessimistic about the human condition” is a bit overstated for an article that strives to remain free of bias. \n",
      "\n",
      "Beckett himself would be the first to disagree with you. He once said that if he were a pessimist, he wouldn’t write.  Although I know that the artist is not always the most reliable source for understanding his work, that ought to count for something.\"\n",

You might be true that there has not been any peer review so far, but by publishing their report they open their work for review by peers. And note that the reputation of NIST is at play here, if some  outside expert can find a major error in their simulations, it should be published in peer reviewed literature and, given consensus in the field about the error, NIST would have to retract its claims. Your words: '\"\"new phenomenon\"\" that is still not clearly explained'. NIST report: new phenomenon that IS explained by basic physics, please read the report and don't distort facts there. \"\"altering input to match the results\"\": this is pretty standard in the simulation business to account for uncertainties in your model and is allowed as long as you alterations are within reasonable limits. And stop whining about the lead investigator, a non-expert boss being able to explain the work of his expert subordinates happens everywhere, media relations is usually part of his job description. \"\"The majority of the engineering community\"\": a few websites is not a majority, please show me a statement by an engineering society or so.

You say that I  'unilaterally and without a source named Guevara as an official \"\"executioner\"\".'  Not true, I did supply a reference  from a reliable source (Behind Che Guevara’s mask, the cold executioner Times Online (from The Sunday Times) September 16, 2007) that I later displaced downward. Yes, I am clearly not interested in the consensus of blatant leftist editors who regard Ernesto \"\"Che\"\" Guevara as their personal hero, or idol, or totem, who believe he should be thought of as an exemplary human being. If user Nubiatech feels offended by the word 'bullshit', I may also feel offended when he/she childishly calls 'POV' my qualification of mass executioner, which by the way is an historical fact, as many sources prove, and which should be familiar terrain to . With all due respect, when he states that \"\"...none of the scholarly journals, or major biographies refer to Guevara primarily in such a manner\"\", one wonders if he has gone through the immense mass of documentation available, for example, from Cuban exiles? The qualification to use should be mass murderer, which Guevara was, instead of the milder executioner. To display respect or deference toward an overt criminal is not only unjustifiable, it is plain hypocrisy.\n",

      " Let's briefly examine what the lead section states about \"\"El Che\"\", to see if all viewoints are represented:\n",
      "  he was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary,  (sounds respectable enough, perhaps chic, even classy)\n",
      " (he was a) politician,                       (respectable enough)\n",
      " (he was an) author,                          (sounds very respectable)\n",
      " (he was a) physician,                        (very respectable indeed)\n",
      " (he was a) military theorist,                (respectable enough)\n",
      " (he was a) guerrilla leader.                 (respectable for some)\n",
      " It should be obvious that there is no balance at all in the above qualifications; they all depict a character that ought to attract admiration, to say the least, hiding the \"\"insignificant\"\" fact that he was a three-hundred-fold manslayer, even calling POV a reference to it. This is the logical consequence of the diligence with which leftist editors quickly delete anything that might mar their hero's image, and even cry foul (like  above) when anyone doesn't abide by their rules. This user even writes \"\"POV (not a fact) mentioned with due weight elsewhere on the article\"\" in his reverting edit summary. Question: if it already is mentioned elsewhere, why there it's not considered 'POV', while within the lead section it is? The marrow of the discussion is that we are not talking of viewpoints here, we are talking about facts.  \n",

I am stating that, based on the manner of this series of reverts on The Automobile Association , followed by this 'rewrite', and based on the fact that HighKing has yet to make any associated comment at Talk:The Automobile Association, instead choosing to treat this as an issue of \"\"vandalism\"\", HighKing has inarguably ignored the warnings Cailil gave him when he re-enacted the BI topic ban about his future conduct. Those can still be seen on his own talk page under the \"\"Removals of the term British Isles (again)\"\" section on HighKing's talk page, so he has no excuse for not remembering them. You're going to have to read that whole thread to get the picture, but it shows quite clearly that Cailil was quite explicit in what he expected from HighKing going forward, in addition to simply adhering to the topic ban: he must stop edit warring and start discussing, he must stop this behaviour of policing terminology on Wikipedia, he must stop introducing (and maintaining by reverts) innacuracies (his altered version of the quote is not in the source, so is clearly innacurate). Basically, he was telling him to just go and find something completely different to do than this, because it is of no benefit to the project. What he has done instead, is just transfer his focus from policing usage of the term 'British Isles' on Wikipeda, to policing the term 'Republic of Ireland', while mainaining the same bad behaviours - edit warring, lack of discussion, misrepresentation of sources, misuse of guidelines/policy, etc, etc. As an administrator, the onus is on you to step in and stop it. Five years is long enough to be still getting away with this sort of WP:TE in the way you have so far allowed him to in this case. You need to block HighKing now until he gives cast iron assurances he understands why Cailil wrote those things on his talk page, and tells you precisely how he proposes to avoid it in future. That's it. As far as evidence goes, short of me pulling out direct quotes of what Cailil said to HighKing, I don't see what more you need to see, to do what is required of you.   \"\n",

      "Hi Edgar. Could you take a look at this page? It seems a little suspicious to me...no references and the only google hits to the 18-ethoxycoronaridine are to the wiki page and the website of the abovementioned Obiter Research (some other ethoxy coronaridine derivatives are found as natural products, but not the 18-). I'm thinking if the University of Vermont had licensed out one of their patented compounds for the development of a new drug addiction treatment medication (the patents on 18-methoxycoronaridine are rather broad so this probably is covered) then they would have made some kind of press release about it?   \n",
      "The compound doesn't show up in SciFinder, but it's not too surprising that nothing has been published yet if it was first synthesized in 2010.  It's quite possible that little is known about it, and it would be too early to be considered a drug addiction treatment, and not yet something to put out a press release about.  So the content of the article doesn't come across as inaccurate to me, but it probably doesn't meet Wikipedia's guidelines pertaining to notability and verifiability.  My guess is that someone involved in the research created the article in a moment of vanity.  It might be best to merge the article into another which already has content about various coronaridine derivatives, such as 18-Methoxycoronaridine.  This would at least put it in context.    (Edgar181) \n",
      "Hmm fair points, I was thinking about just asking the page creator for the relevant patent number so the page at least has a reference. But now that I had a better look I'm still more suspicious about the company, they look like they are just doing a custom synthesis of an obscure material that people might want and trying to sell it for a high price (18-methoxycoronaridine is not readily available from biosciences suppliers like Tocris or Sigma-Aldrich so researchers would probably be interested in a close analogue). And if things like this are anything to go by I feel the page may be more about marketing their poor quality product (they even admit it is racemic on their webshop) than proclaiming their new research. I'd be tempted to email the University of Vermont (or maybe just Dr Glick personally as no doubt he would know) about whether any licensing agreement exists as claimed.   \n",
      "Ok the relevant patent is US 6211360 issued to Stanley D Glick and Martin E Kuehne and the University of Vermont in 2001, but the patent filing was in 1996. So the 18-ethoxy compound is covered by the patent but it isn't one of the examples or preferred compounds\n",

One was given to the Inquisitor, one to the King of England, and one to the Bishop of Beauvais. This Process was made from a certain Minute written in French, by my own hand, which was given up to the Judges, and was afterwards translated from the French into Latin by Monsieur Thomas de Courcelles and myself, in the form in which it now stands, as well and as faithfully as possible, long after the death and execution of Jeanne. As for the Act of Accusation and other parts of the Process, Maitre Thomas de Courcelles had very little to do with these, nor did he greatly interfere with them. \n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to the word Nota, written above certain Articles in the Minute, there was, on the first day of the Inquiry, a great tumult in the Chapel of the Castle at Rouen, where, that day, the interrogation was held, so that Jeanne was interrupted at almost every word, while she was speaking of her apparitions: Certain secretaries were there-two or three-of the King of England, who registered, as they chose, her words and depositions, omitting all her defense and all which tended to exonerate her. I complained of this, saying it was irregular, and that I would not be responsible, as clerk, in this matter: and, therefore, on the morrow, the place of meeting was changed and convened in a certain hall of the Castle, near the Great Hall, while two English were placed to keep order. When there were difficulties as to Jeanne's answers, and some said she had not replied as I had written, I wrote Nota at the top, in order that the questions might be repeated and the difficulties removed. Although it is mentioned in the Process that the Judges stated they had received preliminary evidence, I do not remember to have seen or heard of it; but I know that, if it had been produced, it would have been inserted in the Process. \n",
      "\n",
      "Jeanne was brought to Rouen and not to Paris, because, as I think, the King of England and the principal people of his Council were there. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of the Process, I was sent for to attend a meeting held at a certain house near the Castle, at which were present the Bishop of Beauvais, the Abbe' of Fecamp, Maitre Nicolas Loyseleur, and many others. The Bishop told me it was necessary that I should serve the King: that they meant to bring a fine case against this said Jeanne, and that I was to recommend another greffier to assist me. I therefore nominated Boisguillaume. \n",
      "\n",
      "I met Lohier in the Church, on the day after the Bishop had asked him to give an opinion on the Process, and inquired what he you ght of it. He replied, that the Process was of no value, and could not be maintained, because it was conducted in the Castle and not in a legal court; that it concerned many who were not summoned; that Jeanne had no Counsel: and for many other reasons. He added that, in his opinion, it was their intention to put her to death. \n",
      "\n",
      "A certain Maitre Nicolas de Houppeville was summoned to attend the Trial; and was in great danger, because he refused. Maitre Jean Lemaitre, Sub-Inquisitor, delayed as long as possible his attendance at the Trial, and was much vexed at being compelled to attend. \n",
      "\n",
      "One day, when Jeanne was being questioned, Jean de Chatillon spoke in her favor, saying that she was not compelled to reply to the question put to her, or to that effect. This much displeased the Bishop of Beauvais and his following, and there was a great tumult at his words. The Bishop ordered him to be quiet, and to let the Judges speak. \n",
      "\n",
      "On another occasion, when some one was advising and directing Jeanne on the question of submission to the Church, the Bishop said, \"\"Hold your tongue, in the devil's name!\"\" I do not remember the name of him who was thus spoken to. \n",
      "\n",
      "One day, some one, whose name I do not remember, having spoken of Jeanne in a way which did not please the Earl of Stafford, the latter followed him, sword in hand, to some place of sanctuary; and, if they had not told Stafford that that place was sacred, he would have slain him. \n",

      "Regrettably, I have to agree about the Gameplay section. It comes off more like an academic discourse on the incorporation of multiple characters and changes from previous franchise entries in video games, using Mother 3 as an example, than a proper encyclopedic entry. I won't quickfail just for this, but I do want it fixed before I'll pass. I'd prefer the section to be rewritten entirely, but some glaring points follow:\n",
      "\"\"Mother 3 is presented in eight chapters with rotating player-characters including the protagonist's \"\"cowboy father\"\", the \"\"family dog\"\", an \"\"inept thief\"\", and \"\"abused monkey\"\"\"\" - So is the protagonist not playable? How large is the party? Why are these descriptions in quotes? - it suggests equivocation in your understanding of the characters. Actually, why isn't the protagonist named in this section? Again, I completely understand the desire to approach this from an out-of-universe perspective, but only to the point where the prose doesn't trip over its own detachment.\n",
      "\"\"Mother 3 begins with naming the members of the player-character's family along with questions of the player's favorite food and \"\"thing\"\",[3] and opens to a \"\"pastoral forest village\"\" soon interrupted by a forest fire and the Pig Mask Army, who impose police state-like conditions on the village.[2] With the fire's outbreak, the father ventures out to protect his family (twin sons Lucas and Claus and wife Hinawa), but the rest of the world is eventually implicated in the plot.[1] They set out to take down the Pig Mask Army.[4] Lucas, the game's hero, does not become prominent until the fourth chapter. The game features a lighthearted plot, with enemies like \"\"partying ghosts\"\" and \"\"talking rope snakes\"\".[5] Porky, a character from EarthBound, appears as the leader of the Pig Mask Army and is the game's main antagonist. In addition, other EarthBound characters, such as Dr. Andonuts and Mr. Saturn, also appear.\"\" - Why isn't this stuff in Plot? The cast of characters does need to be introduced better, but jamming plot details into Gameplay isn't the way to do that.\n",
      "The second paragraph is better; it's more in line with what I expect from a GA gameplay section. At least, it's good until \"\"Apart from this rhythm and combo mechanic, the battle system is similar to that of its predecessor.\"\" What's the predecessor's battle system like? Remember, not everyone reading this has played EarthBound.\n",
      "\"\"There is no need to grind for experience and it has no random battles\"\" - First of all, this should start off with a \"\"However\"\" or something of the like as its predecessor does have those things. The information is also lacking, though - why isn't there a need to grind for experience? I think of this as one of the central, love-it-or-hate-it JRPG mechanics, and I'm curious as to how the genre might work without it. Imagine reading a Pokémon game article that simply states that you can change your party as needed (which is unusual for a JRPG) without giving a brief overview of how the PC and Day Care systems work - that's how I feel reading this.\n",
      "\"\" and lets the player see their magic \"\"PSI power\"\" abilities\"\" - Viewing your abilities probably isn't a necessary gameplay detail, but why isn't there anything on the abilities themselves and their use in battle? And do they have uses outside battle, like HMs, Rock Smash, Secret Power, and Softboiled do in Pokémon?\n",
      "\"\"While Mother 3's music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new, it features similar sound effects.\"\" - By \"\"completely new\"\" do you mean it isn't recycled wholesale, or that the style is somehow new? Also, this bit probably doesn't belong in Gameplay.\n",

      "Paragraph 2: There are battles, they're not random (with an explanation of the conditions under which you do encounter battles - is it like in Pokémon Colosseum where you only fight other Trainers, or like in Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury where you can see the enemies on the overworld before fighting them?), this is how the battle system works, this is how items work, this is how experience points/leveling work (again, how is this the case without grinding? Or is a different system used entirely?).\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Your team consists of such-and-such a number of characters, they change with different events in the story, characters do/don't return once they leave, here are examples of the characters and how they differ in and out of battle.\n",

The man had been asked to leave the hallway, but became aggressive and began punching and kicking anyone near by. Presley was entertaining his daughter Lisa Marie at the time, and upon hearing the commotion outside, reached for his guns. This was during the Patty Hearst kidnapping, and, according to David Stanley, “Elvis feared for Lisa’s safety”. The incident resulted in a lawsuit against Sonny West, Dick Grob and David Stanley. Although not physically involved in the attack, Presley was also named on the lawsuit. It was resolved a year later with an out of court settlement, but Presley was not happy with the way Red West had conducted himself during the incident (he had punched the man while he was handcuffed).

This was during the Patty Hearst kidnapping and, according to David Stanley, “Elvis feared for Lisa’s safety”, who was staying in the suite at the time. When the lighting was restored, four men including David Stanley, held the man while three others \"\"beat him to a bloody pulp.\"\" The incident resulted in a lawsuit against Sonny West, Dick Grob and Stanley. Although not physically involved in the attack, Presley was also named on the lawsuit. It was resolved a year later with an out of court settlement. Presley was not happy with the way Red West had conducted himself during the incident, but fans who witnessed it claimed that Presley simply stood by doing nothing to stop the beating. David Stanley recalled Presley telling him later that this was one of the reasons West would later be fired. (citations to be added of course).\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this anecdote is a good tie-in with the book West & co would publish. It could go in the Memphis Mafia article if needed; for this article it might need trimming a bit.   \n",
      "\n",
      "I like the rewrite above. I'm torn now about whether to include it in the article, though. Part of me thinks it's important because it is one of the few noteworthy things Presley actually got involved in between 1974 and 1976 (Most of that time was touring), and it does bring a better understanding to the firing of West and co. Another part of me agrees it could be shortened, but each time I read it I struggle to decide which parts should be removed as I find it all important. Perhaps removing the line; Presley was not happy with the way Red West had conducted himself during the incident, but fans who witnessed it claimed that Presley simply stood by doing nothing to stop the beating. and just going straight from the settlement into David Stanley recalled Presley telling him later that Wests' aggressive beating of the man was one of the reasons he would later be fired.

      "\n",
      "In the recently aired episode, \"\"April in Quahog\"\", Brian can be clearly observed praying some time after the news report leads the public to believe that a black hole is going to swallow the earth. Also, at the end of the episode, Brian leaves the house saying he made a deal with someone that now that the earth is spared he would go volunteer at the soup kitchen. Based on the context of the situation and Stewie's remark in the background that the 'someone' Brian made a deal with was God, this calls Brian's atheism into question and suggests that he has developed some closeted religious beliefs (though other evidence from previous episodes might lead one to suspect that they have been there all along). There are only two other explanations for this series of events that I can think of: One would be that one of the underlying ideas behind the episode is something to the tune of 'there are no atheists in foxholes', though this is unlikely because Brian can be seen following through with his promise which a person who had temporarily reverted to religion because of fear wouldn't do, let alone that any kind of conservative message is very unlike McFarlane. The other would be that McFarlane is somehow poking fun at peoples' work righteous attitude towards religion, however this is also unlikely because in order to understand the joke, an in depth understanding of what Christianity actually teaches would be required which most people (including McFarlane) likely do not posses.\n",

That's it.  In the John H. Sununu article it states his father's profession and where he was from. Also more than this article. In Alexander Haig, a 4 star general and far more notable than Emanuel, there is nothing on his father. In H. R. Haldeman, it says that his father donated money to the Republican party. If that is your basis for the inclusion of a discussion of his father's activities it is pretty weak. Firstly, there is no wikilink that would resolve this addition like [Irgun]].

Second, if the first does not apply, does it feature a major appearance by characters or settings strongly associated with the Final Fantasy series. Kingdom Hearts does, since about half of the major NPCs are from the series. Ehrgeiz does, since it has several playable characters (one of whom is actually on the cover of the game) from Final Fantasy VII. Secret of Evermore might, as well: I was under the impression that the appearances were more along the lines of brief cameos that integral roles, but if someone wants to argue otherwise, I'm listening. Super Mario RPG does not fit under either of these categories: it was never called Final Fantasy: Super Mario RPG (or whatever), and it has but one piece of music to connect it to the series. –\n",

The people of a nation or state; populace... 2. The land of a person's birth or citizenship...\"\"  And \"\"nation\"\":  \"\"1. A relatively large group of people organized under a single, usually independent government; a country.  2.  The government of a sovereign state.\"\"  Thus the word \"\"country\"\" in American English at least is bound up in the notion of sovereignty.  The use of \"\"country\"\" in this title by a single editor is a legal artifact of the wording used to bind Scotland, Wales, etc. to the United Kingdom.

This sort of thing has a couple of likely explanations—Stricker (et al.) are deliberately pointing journal editors at very friendly peer reviewers (and these mostly-crappy, low-impact journals don't do much due diligence), potential conflicts of interest be damned; or these papers are so far out on the fringe that it's very difficult for journal editors to find anyone who is willing to waste time on reviewing manuscripts on these topics, so they're relaxed about their reviewer standards; or both.

According to Jerusalem municipality website, the total population of Jerusalem in 2003 comprised 693,200 people, of which 464,500 (67.0%) were Jews and 228,700 (33.0%) were non-Jews. Since most non-Jewish residents are concentrated in the eastern part of the city, and the count of 410,000 people refers to the 1948-67 Jordanian municipality borders, that would mean that only about 52% of east Jerusalem is populated by non-Jews, and western Jerusalem is populated only by 280,000 persons.

Since we can't look into each other's hearts, and since there can be no assessment of behavior until there is behavior (the only \"\"behavior\"\" now is an occasional note on his talk page), what is it that you would like to hear from Kiefer? And what kinds of restrictions, if any, do you think can be helpful? An Iban with Demiurge is probably a given, as is some type of restriction on RfA, AN(/I) participation, etc. FWIW, I accept his comments about the offending remark; it would have been better if he had swallowed a bit more pride, and it's clear that I'm probably in the minority there, but I do accept it.I sent Kiefer an email a week or so ago, to see how he was doingafter all, we both were blessed with a beautiful child around the same time last yearand I'm trying to figure out a way to heal some wounds. For the record, I have had my disagreements with him and I certainly don't approve of everything he's done here (I'm sure he feels the same way, and that's fine). I don't wish to be an apologist (for any side) and excuse everything that's happened, but I'm trying to find a way forward. I wish, for instance, that he would find it easier to let bygones be bygones (I think I'm paraphrasing GiantSnowman, from an AN thread about a proposed Iban between the two of them, and I wish KF had accepted that from GS). Anyway, this message is longer than I intended it to be, and I apologize for that. I suppose I'm also asking you if (or when) you can let bygones be bygones. There's no immediate urgency for you to respond; if you could ping me when you do, if you do, I'd appreciate it.For the talk page stalkers: please let's not turn this into ANI. I could have emailed Horologium privately, but I prefer to do this here, in between the privacy of email and the dramah of a board. At some point the community will be involved, if this ever gets anywhere; for now I'm interested in Horologium's response (and, possibly, {{|RegentsPark}}'s, since he started this thread).

      "\n",
      "Hello. Could you please stop by Talk:Christianity and give your opinion? We are debating whether the word 'monotheism' should be included in the intro to the Christianity article. According to most dictionaries, the definition of monotheism is The dogma or belief that there is one God. Now, all Christians believe there is one God and all Christian creeds (such as the Nicene Creed and Chalcedonian Creed) profess a belief in one God. The point of contention is the Holy Trinity. Christians believe that God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit all make up one [[Ousia|essense] of God, i.e. are three parts of one God (known as hypostasis). Now, several editors think that because this is different from the Islamic view of Tawhidand they alledge Muslims think Christians are not monotheistic, but [[tritheistic]we cannot say Christianity is monotheistic like is done in the Islam article. Many editors content, however, that the definition of monotheism is based solely on belief, not truth. So if Christians believe their God is one God, they are by definition monotheistic, even if they may not be right. All it takes to be monotheistic is to believe there is one God. Others, however, think we can only say \"\"Christianity is a monotheistic religion according to its followers.\"\" Again, some editors (including myself) have issue with this because it's basically like saying \"\"Christianity believes it believes that there is one God,\"\" which of course is redundant. In my opinion, monotheism by definition is the belief! None-the-less, we would like to know from a Muslim editor: 1) Do Muslims view Christianity as tritheistic? 2) If so, does this view affect that fact that Christians think their God is one God (even though they may not be right), and if not, aren't Christians by definition monotheistic? Sorry for the long post, but there's a lot of debate I had to summarize. Thanks, — \"\n",

As it is election season in the United States, articles about prominent political figures such as Mrs. Clinton are particularly vulnerable, hence the protection. There was a dispute over the reliability of sources, and I protected the article to cool the dispute. Protection isn't an endorsement of the current version, I have no ulterior motive.

      "Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, ... Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.\n",
      "\n",
      "All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.\n",

Please don't take the following as a negative reflection but I wanted to clarify a couple things. People are frustrated because now, as in the past, it seems as thought the WMF doesn't listen to what us editors are saying. Yes you have evidence that you tried to notify users but the way the notifications were done and the places they were located gives the impression that the folks building these changes don't understand the community or how it works. You are also worknig hard to fix the problems but then releae the app to all logged in users knowing there are a lot of problems, many of which are severe. Then you act as though your surprised and hurt that we are annoyed. We know you are working on the problems, but so are we and we want to feel as though our voices are heard too. When the Visual Editor talk pages aren't filled with long lists of complaints and bugs, then we can talk about a widescale release. But there's no need to rush it out yet. Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that the problems aren't with you, they are with the WMF organizations's ongoing policy of doing whatever they feel like regardless of what us dumb editors think. Happy editing. PS, sorry they mixed us up.  \n",

The author of the book further makes all kinds of statements about Vietnamese that with distance sound condiscending or even worse. When the book starts talking about the Vietnamese mind, its almost embarrasing to read it. Yes, it won awards when it was published. But its a very flawed book. For example, the basis of your claim that only 800 people died in the anti-landlord campaign is that her North Vietnamese/NLF friends told the author so. By contrast, Stanley Karnow writing in 1983, was writing in a less hysterical political climate and had access to more material than was available in 1972.\n",

In any case, Ettlinger told me in a private E-mail that he was Jewish (at least by descent - he wasn’t an observant/religious Jew and said something about being a deist), and so I think his article should be added to the American Jews by occupation category. One problem I see there is that I don't see any sub-category for Jewish American Engineers and/or Jewish American software developers (he was both). I know that Richard Stallman is a Jewish (also only by decent) American software developer, and he belongs to the categories \"\"American computer programmers\"\" and \"\"American Jews\"\" and there are naturally many others.

First, you have eliminated the redirect to another page, but haven't put in a hatnote or anything that will indicate to the reader where that page is. But the main problem is that there are no reliable source references that either establish the subject's notability, or support any of the text that is written. The official website, blog, twitter etc - none of those count. There have to be independent third-party sources about the guy, otherwise the whole thing will get deleted. I suggest you get onto that as soon as you can. Let me know at my talk page if you have any questions. Cheers,\n",

We must first encounter that really India as a concept is borrowing or a creation of the invading Aryans (indoeuropeans of iranian orign) that actually settled up north in between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the origin of this culture (later tu establish themselves in Rajasthan, Jammu-Kashmir, Guajarat and north-west regions basically to extend their culture)\n",

Certainly hundreds of thousands, and perhaps more that a million, German POWs died in Allied custody if the Soviet Union is included among the Allies. As well, tens of thousands of German civilians died in Soviet forced-labour crews.\n",
      "Bacque does make a contribution, albeit flawed, to the historiography, one that has been built upon recently by Anthony Beevor and others, who have looked at the immediate post-war period, the state of Europe before the Marshall Plan, the European reconstruction period, the founding of the ECSC and the beginning of the Cold War.\n",

And please explain Purrums, why Grindlay didn't go directly to the authorities to make an official report of Ryan's \"\"alleged verbal\"\" confession? After all, Grindlay was the top-notch man at Pentridge and he surely would called a special meeting to report and discuss such an amazing verbal confession to inform government leaders, prison authorities, televison, radio and other media journalists from around Australia, prosecutors and defence laywers, Father Brosnan and et al. Why would Ryan confess to Grindlay while at the eleventh-hour Ryan wrote letters to various people protesting his innocence? Ryan had to write his letters on toilet paper and then he was also refused his right to make a \"\"last statement\"\" just prior to execution. Smells fishy to me! The various documentary films, based on meticulous research including archival material and interviews by living people (including Grindlay) who were directly involved in the Ryan case do not even mention such a confession taking place - because it didn't happen!

He was defined as Jewish by the Nazi Party, because they made the innovation of treating Jews as a race, not a religious community.

There are Ethiopians who are as light or lighter than him, but they are very few in number, so I wouldn't say that he's darker than \"\"a lot\"\" of Ethiopians. I would put those at or around his skin color at 10% tops, with those lighter than him much less than that. However, the pictures that you linked to seem to have bad lighting, which is why he appears darker than in other shots. If you look here, for example, you'll see that he's not actually that dark.

      "Took me a while to figure out what you were talking about; that edit was almost a month ago.  The explanation on the page suggested that making the edit would block the script running the bot from its source, which was the intention.  Blocking the IP it was using as a logged-out bot, which is what was originally done, was causing collateral damage.  All bots are supposed to know that they're logged out and stop themselves (or be able to log themselves back in); the absence of that section of code is a serious matter, because bot editing is restricted to named bot accounts, and is essentially a malfunction.  Just think if someone had blocked the range (which someone was considering doing!), not realizing that it was the WMF Labs - none of the Labs-based tools regularly used on this project would have functioned, and cross-wiki bot activity would also have been adversely affected.  Better than 90% of bots include code that tells the bot how to check if it is logged in, and what to do if it is not, and many that don't require hands-on control. There's no reason for these ones not to include that code. Heck, they can probably swipe it from one of the other open-source coded bots currently in operation.  \n",
      "I'm also confused by your statement,  was the bot blocked or not? and was it editing logged-in or logged-out?

An ethnic group is a group of people who closely identify with one-another (sometimes through having common ancestors, but not necessarily so) and share a unique culture and language. Persian Jews definitely fall in this category.

      " If the album is to be defined as Neo-Soul then, what gives it that exclusivity if other artists such as Miguel, Alicia Keys, Erykah Badu, and others don't get when describing their albums, which have the same roots, the same influences, the same marketing, but yet critics aren't explicitly calling these albums strictly \"\"Neo Soul\"\" albums? Alicia Keys' last three albums do not have \"\"Neo-Soul\"\" affixed in their list of genres on their respective articles. In fact, in addition to soul, Pop and R&B; are both listed on the pages of those albums Girl on Fire (album), The Element of Freedom, As I Am. Take those labels off if her albums are just supposed to be \"\"Neo-Soul\"\" like the way it is on The 20/20 Experience. And perhaps if Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, whom are known to be Calypso/Soca band put an album out and a critic calls it Zouk or Zydeco, but yet the music is clearly the same as the music they've put out before, when is the line drawn before we decide that maybe the critics may have judged it hastily or perhaps they are misguided if the music obviously falls in the band's native style? Wikipedia has an article on the Punta Music, which is music of my culture the Garifuna people, but what stops a critic from saying it's pop, or neo-soul, then having Wikipedia and the people who read reviews accept it as such? Would that not be taking away the cultural context? Would that not be debasing the originality of the said style? Would that not give way to confusion to a person who knows nothing about the music? Where is the line drawn? I'm saying, where's the consistency? Why not describe the music in a holistic sense and not just based on what a couple people, no matter how credible, might assume it to be? The reviewer Steven Hyden (), described \"\"Mirrors\"\" as \"\"Zepplinesque\"\", does that make it a rock song, because he said so? In Pitchfork, the writer described \"\"Don't Hold the Wall\"\" as having \"\"Bhaṅgṛā rhythms\"\",   does that put the song in that genre? I'm not following this logic.  Speaking to the claim that Pop and R&B; describing the root of most popular music, The 20/20 Experience can be Neo-Soul to some people, but it can't be denied that it is also Pop, since it's on the pop charts, and the argument of whether it is pop or not is moot because of it's popularity and extent of exposure, and it is R&B;, because it's presence on the R&B; charts, which just as easily gives way to how the album is marketed also, the way the Neo-Soul style was when it first emerged. Yes, Pop, Rock and R&B; is the etymological root of most popular music, but that does not stop writers of album articles on Wikipedia from using them to describe the popular music they are describing. If that mattered, then those aforementioned genres should never be used to describe the music on an album released under the scope of popular music if the aim is to describe it so perfectly and narrow-mindedly.\"\n",

Everyone who posts in Wikipedia is a real person; we use log-in identities to protect our privacy and our private identities.  If someone uses his or her real name in Wikipedia, it is published in this version of Wikipedia and all over the internet.  I have no control over others' practices in choosing Wikipedia identities, and I am not aware of anything that I have done that violates WP:AGF, WP:CIVIL, Wikipedia:Etiquette in my comments in either of the AN/I situations.  Although I have continually posted my concerns in good faith, I have been continually set upon as if I have not.  I assure you that since first contributing to Wikipedia as \"\"NYScholar\"\" in June 2005, I have done my best to learn about and to follow Wikipedia's obviously-convoluted and often contradictory editing policies and guidelines, which are frequently edited and changed by those editing Wikipedia, and often vandalized.  I have done my best to contribute to Wikipedia in good faith and yet be forced (demanded) to respond to in my own view entirely-unfounded and false charges that I have not been editing in good faith.  Despite my requests for compassion and understanding because I have other important non-Wikipedia work to do (which have been in the \"\"N.B.\"\" above and were only edited out in the past two days in response to Shell's comments about the \"\"N.B.\"\" section), I was continually being forced by administrators and others to reply to them in what I increasingly regard as a dysfunctional AN/I based on both misunderstandings and violations of the AN/I instructions by the user who posted it and by the continual references to a previous AN/I by others, including administrators, extending it when it should have been expunged.\n",

      "Its not that virtue ethicists today would accept Aristotle's particular understanding of human nature and, by consequence, his table of virtues- but rather that they are willing to pursue the virtues via an understanding of man qua animal, which MacIntyre rejects.  That is, the project of virtue ethics today is not just the uncovering of one's social roles and an embodiment of the excellences which one's social narrative provides as MacIntyre conceives of it in After Virtue.  Most contemporary virtue ethicists would object to such a socially situated view of human nature and instead favor a return to the Aristotelian project of examining the essential nature of man.

      "LEGAZPI CITY - Posting an impressive 77 percent improvement over previous year’s performance, Naga City and Camarines Sur combined took the highest number of tourist arrivals in Bicol, more than half of the regional total for the year 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a report on the regional distribution of travelers in Bicol prepared by the regional office of the Department of Tourism here, Naga/Camarines Sur registered a total number of 456,911 tourists, domestic and foreign, for the period January to December last year. This is slightly more than half the regional total of 897,680 tourists that visited Bicol during that period.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report also showed that Naga/Camarines Sur’s performance is also about three times higher than the number of tourists posted by erstwhile top tourist drawer Legazpi/Albay which garnered a total of 141,855 tourists or an increase of only 6 percent over previous year’s performance which was 133,440 in 2006.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next higher performer over previous year’s record is the island province of Catanduanes which posted an impressive 76 percent increase, from 29,026 in 2006 to 51,055 tourist arrivals in 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other island province of Masbate produced a total of 107,008 tourists, or 39 percent higher than its total tourist arrivals of 77,130 tourists in 2006.\n",
      "\n",
      "Camarines Norte posted an improved performance of 10 percent, from 73,539 in 2006 to 80,936 in 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the six provinces in Bicol, only Sorsogon posted a negative 8 percent in its performance as it was only able to draw a total of 59,915 tourists in 2007, which was 5,369 short of its 65,384 tourists recorded in 2006.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorsogon, despite its Butanding, is also known to be rebel-infested where there have been incidents of clashes between government troopers and the communist guerrillas, aside from the alarming cases of extra-judicial killings by both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Albay and Sorsogon felt the brunt of recent volcanic eruptions and ash falls and were heavily battered by floods and typhoons during the past two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Naga/Camarines Sur registered the highest number of foreign tourists in 2007 at 45,626 compared to Legazpi/Albay’s 36,608.\n",
      "\n",
      "From January to September 2007, according to an earlier report by theDOT regional office, Legazpi/Albay was leading in the number of foreign tourists, 36,000 vs Naga/Camarines Sur’s 28,851, until the figures changed during the final quarter of the year of the year with Naga/Camarines Sur finally breaking away with almost 9,000 foreign tourists more.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the previous year, or in 2006, Naga/Camarines Sur also outclassed Legazpi/Albay in foreign tourist arrivals, 25,832 vs 8,765.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the total regional tally of tourist arrivals totalled only 897,680, or 103,320 short of hitting the one million mark, Bicol nonetheless recorded an improvement of 41 percent over previous year’s performance. In 2006, Bicol was able to draw a total of 637,127 tourists, both domestic and foreign.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total number of foreign tourists that came to Bicol doubly improved from 49,304 in 2006 to 105,608 in 2007.\n",

The third paragraph that was previously removed, and which I have now reinstated, contains relevant description for this article.  Similar descriptions appear in other porn-related articles on wikipedia.  As for the pictures, the lead image is a promotional photo head shot and it is a much better representation of the subject than an amateur fan pic.  The \"\"Helles Belles\"\" image illustrates relevant text in the article.  In fact, fair use rationales and appropriate licensing tags have been provided for both of these images.  I don't understand what the problem is since both images are regularly used for promotional purposes by the copyright holder to market Laura Angel and products related to her.  Thus, the appearance of these same images on wikipedia is altogether fair and appropriate as an accurate visual representation of the subject.  Also, both of the images I have added to this article are much more characteristic of Laura's professional appearance than the Brussels fan pic.

      "In chapter nine Burlington, Vermont Kolbert writes about Burlington, Vermont’s largest city. Years ago the citizens decided to stand up to global warming by using less power instead of buying more. The mayor of Burlington, Peter Clavelle, who has been mayor since 1989, came up with a program that encourages contractors to engage not in demolition but in “deconstruction”. This helps the city save energy by reducing waste and cutting down the need for new materials. Burlington’s electric department (BED) has a wind turbine that provided enough power for thirty homes and gets half of its energy from renewable sources, such as its 50 megawatt power plant that runs off of wood chips. The BED also leases compact florescent light bulbs for twenty cents a month because a family who uses these bulbs can cut their electricity bill by 10 percent. The city of Burlington estimates that their energy saving projects over the course of this lifetime will prevent the release of 175,000 tons of carbon. Burlington residents also eat locally and have turned old waste sites into an assortment of community gardens and cooperatives, the waste from these gardens is taken to a composting factory, and turned back into soil, making this process “closed loop”. Clavelle’s plan has begun to pick up across America beginning with Greg Nickles, the mayor of Seattle, who created a set of principles called the “US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement”. This agreement has been signed by over a hundred and seventy mayors, representing about thirty – six million people. This agreement is trying to prove how much can be done at the local level and Clavelle hopes that more cities will adopt this plan.\n",

      "And, for those wars that resulted in a great deal of change to military technology, either because they were very long (like the Hundred Years' War) or very intense (like WWI or WWII), we should discuss technological escalation as a separate topic, more abstract than the equipment and tactics, less abstract than history and strategy.  See technological escalation during WWI for an example - this can be done for WWII, US Civil War, Napeolonic wars, at least, as well, and maybe also for the Cold War.  This gets into the mechanics of how things changed, how they thought, etc., and really isn't the same topic as either history/strategy or equipment/tactics for the guys on the ground using  the equipment to perform the tactics.\n",

The video is not verified as authentic.  I've seen it, and it appears to be highly edited, which could drastically affect its authenticity.  Jagex has acknowledged and fixed the problem.  The coincidence that it happened on a specific date is just that, coincidence.  No one but the vandals who keep changing the article calls it the 666 massacre.  That's just silly.

      "These all seem to be reasonable solutions, if a little stop-gappy.  I think my problem is that I am seeing this as an outsider to this UK group and the UK group might be seeing the article as a group of insiders writing for insiders.  My initial problem with the article was that it is unclear and allows different incompatible readings.  \"\"Administrative geography\"\" certainly makes the article more consistent, but I'm not sure it makes the title more understandable (unless, of course, you are a geographer or know all the branches of geography).  To benefit neophytes (perhaps I presume too much in thinking this is the intended audience of wikipedia and any other encyclopedia articles) on the subject which this article addresses, I would make the following suggestions.  1) Gut as much of the introduction as possible regarding the four countries and, instead, refer people to that article (since it already exists; which would also resolve some problems people have with repetition between these two articles.  2) Explain what \"\"administrative geography\"\" addresses (e.g., national and local government hierarchies) and how this relates to this article.  3) For the love of God, rename (to whatever is appropriate) the section entitled \"\"In the UK\"\" (or eliminate this title) because it serves no purpose whatsoeverperhaps to \"\"contemporary administration\"\" or something that transitions from \"\"History\"\"; although for reasons beyond my comprehension, some people are apparently wedded till death to that vacuous phrase (i.e., In the UK).  4) Move the last paragraph of the Intro (beginning with \"\"Historically...\"\") to the History section or exapnd on the themes it introduces. 5) Identify the referent of \"\"This structure\"\" in the History section (i.e., answer the question, \"\"What structure?\"\").  6) Follow strict style guidelines for the terms \"\"division[s]\"\" and \"\"subdivision[s]\"\" throughout this article if either is a significant concept for this article.  7) Incorporate the \"\"Parliamentary representation\"\" section into the section preceding it.  This would give a structure of [Introduction], History, Contemporary Administration (or whatever), Informal (Sub)Divisions, International (Sub)Divisions. As things stand, having a separate section for informal divisions suggests the rest of the article is about formal divisions, which would be fine if the sections reflected a more transparent and sensible organization to the article currently lacking.   \"\n",

Some of the the sub topics fail to justify how they help explain the primary topic, instead they mention tangential controversy wihout satisfactorily connecting that controversy with the subject matter. For example, mention of the Reimer case does not contribute to the sub matter here. Another example would be failure to cite the actual Johns Hopkins articles, the evidence of their bias and lack of scientif rigor, or the various subsequent studies that refute the Johns Hopkins article, which is over 25 years old and out dated at best. Also few other topics on medical procedures spend so much time discussing external opinions about them made by religious extremists, who lack medication education.

      "\n",
      "Lady Gaga's public perception is always amongst the most controversial of topics in popular culture. Debate about her style and influence on youth stems from her unceasing desire to walk the thin line between daring and inappropriate. The pop stars ability to command the attention of her fans and critics is unmatched and with a growing list of hit records she has solidified herself as a marketable brand. Her 2.8 million Twitter followers and 5.2 million Facebook fans represent evidence of her ability to move product (Hampp, 2010). With opposing ideals about the negative or positive impact of her music, fashion, and public statements there is little question that the benefits of her talent outweigh the detriments. Her fan base and customer base are similar in nature because they are both drawn to her outspoken and outrageous personality (Hampp, 2010).\n",

For if the British capital could be reduced to chaos, the task of the invading armies would be enormously simplified (...) 'The British', he screeched, 'drop their bombs indiscriminately and without plan on civilian residential quarters and farms and villages. For three months I did not reply because I believed that they would stop, but in this Mr. Churchill saw a sign of our weakness. The British will know that we are now giving our answer night after night. We shall stop the handiwork of these night pilots.' Three days later, on 7th September, the Luftwaffe abandoned its offensive against the sector stations and began the assault on London.

We were interested in evaluating the controversial claims of \"\"Russian torsion field weapons\"\" and, therefore brought Gennady Shipov over from Moscow several times. On one trip Shipov lived with Sarfatti for about 2 weeks. Richard Hammond, and American physicist from Fargo working on torsion fields for US Navy at one time was brought in as well as R. Kiehn a former scientist for US SAC and retired professor from University of Houston.  Shipov worked with Akimov in Moscow who allegedly had strong military connections in the Soviet era. Sarfatti was the senior theorist on the American side of the ISSO core staff that included Saul-Paul Sirag. He arranged for Creon Levit to be borrowed from NASA AMES to run the daily operations of the project. Over a million dollars was given to SARA, a TRW spinoff DOD contractor in Huntington, Beach CA to further test a system developed by Jim Corum. Corum also wrote papers on \"\"The Philadelphia Experiment\"\" and had entre to the Tesla Archive in Beograd even during the Cold War. This was unusual. Corum later went to ISR in W.Va, a think tank doing exotic work with USG funds provided by Senator Robert Byrd and his Congressional counter-part in his home district. The key objective, of course, was to try to figure out how the \"\"saucers\"\" really flew. All of the key scientists had interest in that, with the possible exception of Hammond and Kiehn. Harold Puthoff was brought in as a consultant. Ken Shoulders was also involved as were many others whose schemes were tested. The key foreign figure was Professor J. P. Vigier from Paris who had been Louis DeBroglie's assistant for decades. Sarfatti arranged for a Telegraph Hill Penthouse for Vigier to spend extended periods meeting the scientists flowing through ISSO. Vigier and Levit made a trip to Budapest in 2000 to meet with two Serbian physicists  Z.Maric  & A. Dragic who were experimentally testing an exotic atomic energy release idea of Vigier's of obvious interest to USG Intelligence because of its WMD implications. See the paper \"\"On the possible Existence of Tight Bound States in Quantum Mechanics\"\". pp 349-356 of the same volume of one of Sarfatti's papers, i.e. Vol 126 of Fundamental Theories of Physics, ISBN 1-4020-0885-6. This is not a coincidence. There are few coincidences in \"\"this Looking Glass War Twilight Zone interface between physics and politics\"\" to quote Sarfatti in one of his more eloquent moments. ;-) In fact, ISSO paid most of the expenses for the meeting upon which the volume is based. Enuff said. I hope this helps to somewhat clarify Sarfatti's multiple roles in these events. Sarfatt is a kind of a canary in the mind shaft for MASINT. For example, he was quite alarmed about an immanent attack on important US Military targets in the Fall of 2001. Sarfatti wrote numerous e-mails on this during July & Aug 2001. It seems to be a case of precognitive remote viewing. Unfortunately, Sarfatti was not able to pinpoint the exact time and place of the attack (attacks). He had guessed Oct 2001 because of some big anti-space weapons rally by leftist groups scheduled for that time at Lockheed-Martin. [User:UFO_Black_Ops]]  Oct 16, 2005\"\n",

I think we should find a middle ground, while at the same time keep things as simple as possible. In order to do so, I would scrap criteria 3 and 8, and use a criteria based on rankings determined by Fight Matrix. That criteria could amount to 1/3 or 1/2 of all possible points. The advantages would be that the main organizations would certainly be ahead of other, while at the same time event short lived but notable organizations would have a high score. By using Fight Matrix, we would be able to easily determine how many points defunct organizations would have. Maybe we could present such a system as a possible substitute to the current way we use to determine notability?\n",

Unfortunately, due to the tyrannical trends of namby pamby liberalism (Labour UK, for example), not much genuine research can be done in the subject, because it's quite politically incorrect these days. For example, when a university professor says that on average Black people score lower in IQ tests than white people, said professor gets voted out of tenure 600 to 1. So it's not good practice for libertarian capitalists to bother trying to counter argue against all this namby pamby left wing crap. Labour UK is a twisted experiment, which, although capitalist and ostensibly right wing, has introduced very bizarre left wing projects in to the political playing field: such as, teaching young children about homosexuality in schools, trying to make gay hate a crime like race hate, trying to make condemnation of monotheistic religions a crime, with use of the truth distorting term 'incitement to religious hatred' etc. We are on the losing side, those of us who love truth.

It was not possible to provide public evidence without giving further publicity to a website which engages in stalking, and which gave speculation about not only SlimVirgin's identity, but also another contributor's. And you seem to be overlooking the fact that Cyde was in a longstanding dispute with SlimVirgin, so obviously should not have been the one to block. See also . This is not a question of making a mistake in believing WordBomb. This is a question of believing WordBomb, and then, instead of reporting it privately to the ArbCom, or asking SlimVirgin privately for an explanation, engaging in extremely inappropriate, hasty, behaviour, even crowing over the person he was accusing of sockpuppetry, and showing most clearly that he had a grudge against her. Additionally, in another case which is being heard at the moment, a user who had originally registered with his real name requested a name change, and repeatedly asked people not to keep referring to him by his old name, and Cyde responded by provocatively posting a link to the user rename log.

And you find how elegantly electrodynamics and gravitational waves fit into the curvature play, look at the basic work of Lichnerowics. As an ,algebraiker' I like to write the curvature structure in the following triple form, generalizing the concept of Lie triples (the book of Otmar Loos is a nice generalization of Lie theory):\n",

Note that the complete work of Ricci, Einstein and Weyl can be summarized as a decomposition of the space of curvature structures of Levi type (for Lie algebras).

Truth is, Opas wrote many articles, which have always clearly stated the \"\"facts\"\" - that only one single shot was heard by all persons and prison officer Paterson testified he fired one single shot. Also, prison officer Pascoe admitted on national television in 1986 (19 years after Ryan was hanged) that he fired a shot from tower 3, which might have killed Hodson. Pascoe stated that he was a young scared coward at the time for keeping quiet as he didn't want to get into trouble and lose his job. Hence, there has been much speculation over the decades of where the fatal shot was fired from, and by whom. The \"\"fact\"\" remains that the police and prosecution failed, for whatever reason, to provide a shred of scientific forensic evidence, which would have proven beyond reasonable doubt who's rifle fired the fatal shot. Nobody's rifle was ever tested. There were lots of prison officers with lots of rifles at the time everyone heard one single shot. Not one single rifle, including Ryan's rifle, was tested for evidence. This is a \"\"fact\"\".

Anyway, these above entries are nice reports, though unfortunately they do not add much to the questions on notability.

The question is why/how does these references establish notability? If he's interviewed about something, that establishes the notability of the subject of the interview. Rather than saying \"\"this seems to me to [this or that]\"\" - responses on this topic need to be \"\"this reference establishes/fails to establish notability because...\"\" The further one reads into the wiki explanations about notability for people, these cites for Raymond do not have material that is even close:\n",

The person has made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his or her specific field.

I know he received one which was delivered by someone from Denmark. But I know that the letter was completely different from what is claimed by Mr. Tosa. That is also easy to believe if you are member of a Genseiryu organization in Ito which was directly connected to sensei Shukumine where Sensei Shukumine still gave, in very few occasions, lectures about Genseiryu (pictures are on the way (few days necessary)). So you can imagine you don't beg for acknowledgement by Mr. Tosa who only wants you to train his way, which is very near to Shotokan with the basic kata of Shotokan. This dojo in Holland is not interested in any connection with Mr. Tosa. For what reason, if you want to train Genseiryu the same way as sensei Shukumine taught his students? The Head Instructor of this organization is now Sensei Kanai one of the first students of Sensei Shukumine. In Sensei Shukumine's book \"\"Shin Karatedo Kyohan\"\" there are several pictures of teachers who are still in this group.

The types of people listed preceding \"\"humanists\"\" are defined by what they *do* (i.e. study, teach, do medical research) which makes sense in the context of talking about the commonplace book as one of their tools.  \"\"Humanists\"\" defines people of a certain ethical ideologywhat does that have to do with the function of a commonplace book?  Is the use of a commonplace book particularly defined by one's world perspective?  To me this would be akin to writing \"\"many blogs are maintained by writers, professors, lawyers, editorialists, and Republicans/Democrats\"\" in an article about blogs.

      "That is supposedly. However this article's content and Devdutt article s are very similar. And that is not just because they both are about Ashokasundari. The way these two articles is written is very similar. Also remember that a web portal sources its information from various sources even the news. Also you should know that 's article also appeared in Times of India. Should we use that as a source just because it appeared in a news website? Obviously not. All information must be verified. If you think that a folk tale about a god or a goddess can't appear in a book then think again.Vishnu maya is not mentioned in any scripture. His origins too are folk legends however the source I have used on his article clearly mentions he is a non Sanskritic deity. Also there is a folk tale about Shiva dancing nude to make Kali run away from a forest. However it is mentioned in a book that I read on Google. I am not at all against adding information about Ashokasundari to her article I actually in support of it. However the information should be first proved reliable and true without a doubt. Besides I think it is not such a big deal that the thing about the folk tale can't be added ,even if might be true (which is unlikely). Actually believe me it's not even that much important since the main reason behind creating Ashokasundari article was to prove that there did exist a daughter of Shiva and being able to prove just that is a big achievement in itself.\n",

Might I point you in the direction of WikiProject Red Hot Chili Peppers? It's a place where some of us collaborate together on RHCP articles.

I don't think it's a reliable source (see Wikipedia:Reliable sources) as it appears to be a fairly new, non-notable website.

      "Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the \"\"Nationalism\"\" movement, the \"\"Nationalist\"\" magazine, the \"\"Nationalist Educational Association,\"\" their dogma of \"\"military socialism,\"\" and Edward inspired the \"\"Nationalist Party.\"\"  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (\"\"Hakenkreuz\"\" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist.\"\" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand \"\"Nazi.\"\"  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no \"\"Nazi Party\"\" because it was actually the \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party\"\" and the party members did not call themselves \"\"Nazis\"\" nor the \"\"Nazi Party.\"\"    The term \"\"Nazi\"\" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party.\"\"  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a \"\"Nazi\"\" too, in that the term means \"\"National Socialist.\"\"  The term \"\"Nazi\"\" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   \n",

      "The Bible in Matthew says to put your light on the top of the basket, not under it.  The foundation of notability is identifiability, which I think the congregation at KUC, insisting that they are not a building, is successfully obfuscating by having no pictures of the building on their website.  To quantify this statement, it took me eight full man hours to find KUC on a Google satellite map.  It was easy enough to locate the intersection, but looking at [the picture] on Google, there is no reason to suspect that the building in the distance is the church.  Zeroing in on the actual location was finally accomplished by finding a picture of the church on the web site of the architects of the church, and comparing this street view with the aerial view available from Google.  (Of course, by the liberal definition, I still haven't found the church on Google, because the church is not a building.  If this is your personal view, then you need to consider that this congregation is not currently WP:N notable.)  So assuming that the congregation feels righteous and will not help in identifying their we-are-not-a-building building, I'd suggest that the first thing you could do to improve the notability of KUC is to work on its identifiability: (1) get the maps specifically including Google improved, i.e., get the Google place marker on the building instead of in the middle of the street intersection, (2) does the church have a street address, (3) make your own web site with pictures of the building identifying the building as owned by KUC.  Include pictures of the view toward the surrounding area, such as showing where people park on Sunday morning, the Kippax Fair, and the \"\"adjacent park\"\" where the Christmas Day 2005 services were held. Is the maximum seating capacity of the sanctuary recorded by the fire department?  If there is a sign posted to that effect, the sign could be photographed.\n",

      "Assuming you have access to local libraries and local newspaper archives that go back to 1969 that would include articles about the previous names for the church, you should be able to find additional articles that are not available on the internet so as to satisfy WP:GNG.  You could report these references on your new web site.\n",

      "\n",
      "I think the AfD problem here is that people are questioning churches on the definition of notability in WP:N, \"\"worthy of notice\"\" without being able to articulate or quantify their objection.  Note the argument in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Birchcliff Bluffs United Church that the church there was WP:RUNOFTHEMILL.  The argument is bogus, because the closest example in the essay is a bank that has been in the news five times in 30 years because of being robbed, whereas the church in question could be expected to have mentions, or more, in 500 articles in the last 90 years.  But I think the attitude is real.    \"\n",

Everyone who posts in Wikipedia is a real person; we use log-in identities to protect our privacy and our private identities.  If someone uses his or her real name in Wikipedia, it is published in this version of Wikipedia and all over the internet.  I have no control over others' practices in choosing Wikipedia identities, and I am not aware of anything that I have done that violates WP:AGF, WP:CIVIL, Wikipedia:Etiquette in my comments in either of the AN/I situations.  Although I have continually posted my concerns in good faith, I have been continually set upon as if I have not.  I assure you that since first contributing to Wikipedia as \"\"NYScholar\"\" in June 2005, I have done my best to learn about and to follow Wikipedia's obviously-convoluted and often contradictory editing policies and guidelines, which are frequently edited and changed by those editing Wikipedia, and often vandalized.  I have done my best to contribute to Wikipedia in good faith and yet be forced (demanded) to respond to in my own view entirely-unfounded and false charges that I have not been editing in good faith.  Despite my requests for compassion and understanding because I have other important non-Wikipedia work to do (which have been in the \"\"N.B.\"\" above and were only edited out in the past two days in response to Shell's comments about the \"\"N.B.\"\" section), I was continually being forced by administrators and others to reply to them in what I increasingly regard as a dysfunctional AN/I based on both misunderstandings and violations of the AN/I instructions by the user who posted it and by the continual references to a previous AN/I by others, including administrators, extending it when it should have been expunged.\n",

      "\n",
      "Crunch (AGT Crunch Acquisition, LLC) is a fitness-based enterprise that is focused on making entertainment an integral part of the exercise experience. Established in New York in 1989, today the Crunch brand has 27 locations in 7 major urban centers in the United States: New York City, Brooklyn, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a strategy, Crunch has concentrated on expanding inside of these urban centers: its penchant for innovation resonating especially well with the various demographics therein.  Because of these factors the brand is often associated with descriptors such as “hip”, “edgy”, “urban” etc. and has an air of inherent coolness that the majority of its competitors cannot claim to.\n",
      "\n",
      "FEATURES:\n",
      "\n",
      "1)TABGROUP FITNESS CLASSES\n",
      "Since its inception Crunch has maintained a focus on its group fitness program as the brand’s cornerstone. As such, it has built an extensive catalogue of classes that are characterized by their broad appeal and inventiveness. Numbering in the hundreds, these classes are organized into three different categories: Action Sports, Chill Outs and Dance Rhythms. Examples (taken from the official Crunch website) include:\n",
      "Urbanathlete (Action Sports)\n",
      "This circuit-style class is based on Men’s Health Magazine’s Fitness Challenge.  In it you’ll work through obstacles and exercises that were inspired by various cityscapes and come to see just about any sprawling metropolis as a big, concrete playground. \n",
      "\n",
      "Antigravity Yoga ‘Wings’ (Chill Outs)\n",
      "Wings’ will have you stretching further and holding challenging poses longer, using only a fabric trapeze to do so.  And, by employing simple suspension techniques you’ll move into poses that are seemingly impossible.  However, the goal isn’t just to turn you into a human pretzel: those poses will help to relieve compressed joints and align your body from head to toe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardio Dance Blast (Dance Rhythms)\n",
      "Get your groove on in this sixty-minute class that’s been cleverly disguised as a dance party – one with a soundtrack comprised of the best in hip-hop, reggae and top-forty music.  You’ll melt away fat while bringing your dance skills to the next level and beyond.\n",
      "In addition, Crunch offers private versions of their classes for small groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "2)TABPERSONAL TRAINING\n",
      "Each Crunch location has a staff of personal trainers available to its members for individual or semi-private sessions. Crunch divides these personal trainers into four different categories based on experience and certifications earned. (All of Crunch’s personal trainers are required to have a minimum of professional experience and certifications earned prior to being hired.) Collectively, these trainers have expertise in a broad range of areas. Quoting from the company’s press kit, “All Crunch clubs are staffed with first-rate fitness professionals – personal trainers with certifications in a wide variety of specialties: strength training, yoga, boxing, kickboxing, pre/post natal, kettle bells, physical rehabilitation and much more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3) EQUIPMENT\n",
      "All Crunch locations feature a wide array of fitness equipment produced by the industry’s leading manufacturers: Precor, Life Fitness, Netpulse, Expresso, Icarian, Hammer Strength etc. This equipment is updated with an eye toward keeping current with emerging technologies and trends. For example Crunch is phasing in Life Fitness’ treadmills with built-in iPod functionality. Select Crunch locations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles feature Pilates studios equipped with both Reformers and Wunda Chair Systems and locations in all markets feature Yoga studios. Additionally, certain facilities have more elaborate features: full-sized boxing rings, swimming pools, indoor tracks, basketball courts, saunas, hot tubs and sundecks.  \n",

      "Crunch health clubs are home to a unique fusion of entertainment and fitness, one that we have pioneered from our inception and continue to explore through a number of different channels. In-gym parties and performances (by students of Scratch DJ Academy), an outdoor summer concert series, partnerships with cutting-edge theatrical productions like Spiegelworld and Fuerzabruta and our Broadway Dance Series are all hallmarks of this exploration. Additionally, we’ve developed a number of events that take place outside of our gyms, like field trips (which are held year-round in all of our markets and vary greatly in destination) a\n",

Wikipedia has a lo-n-n-ng future ahead of it as a very well-known planet-wide resource. Someday a criminal will post details of a crime, challenging law enforcement (and Wikipedians) to put the puzzle together. Or perhaps a slightly cleverer criminal will post disinformation here hoping to send the cops and/or feds up an empty trail... All this is easy to imagine, and if I may be so bold as to offer Jimbo advice: it will be best to keep Wikipedia/media rather decentralized and amorphous, with no real \"\"legal department\"\" to be subpoenaed for deposition or testimony. You'll need a \"\"volunteer spokesperson\"\" like Ms. Cary Bass on an ongoing basis, but if you begin to present a standard corporate public face, you'll find yourselves incurring expenses like a corporation.

Take its incarnation in Saudi Arabia and compare it to the village enforcement groups found in northern Pakistani villages, for instance. Or the versions in Egypt and Yemen, which have (at least at this point) more to do about making sure that the only version of Islam practiced is the state-sponsored one.

Your whole case on my alleged incivility builds upon the misguided interpretation of the term nationalism which is not derogatory in English language. None of the links provided define it as such. Yes it can be argued to be semantically close to chauvinism, but chauvinism is a pejorative term, nationalism isn't. There are many related terms which overlap semantically, one having pejorative connotations, other one being neutral. I've asked you where exactly do you see personal attack and you failed to respond. Ignoring Serbian POV on the article on Gundulić is POV-pushing regardless whether you perceive it as such or not. One week block is way to excessive for calling somebody a nationalist. Balkans-related talk page discussions abound in liberal usage of that word by multitude of involved editors, and no one ever felt hurt about it. What is even more appalling is the enforcing admin's inability to see the larger picture - i.e. you ignoring your fellow Croatians' provoking insults at me, while at the same time pushing for a POV in articles, and using completely unrelated policy to get me blocked.\n",

      " hello I'm a resident of Indio Cal. and the regional term isn't as strong. More people use the term \"\"desert\"\" or \"\"southwest\"\" than the terms \"\"Sou Cal\"\" or \"\"Inland Empire\"\". There's a similarity in geography and landscape with Arizona and Nevada for those living in the Indio area. Culturally, the high Latino/Hispanic element might have to do with the name change, as some in Imperial county might refer to \"\"American Mexico/ Mex-USA\"\". Indio and Coachella became one of the U.S./Cal. highest concentrates of Hispanic or Mexican Americans, since immigration was very high for the two towns in the 1990s. I been to Imperial County, there's still plenty of farmland and the towns are growing within the confines of city limits. It's going to change and with NAFTA passed in 1993, the border city of Calexico seem to boom and thrive the most. Mexicali is a major city, the capital of Baja Cal. Mexico and perhaps the closest major city from Indio than Riverside or San Diego. The regional term seems to follow where white Anglos are the majority, but the eastward move of more (no pun intended) to Indio-Coachella to purchase a new home or property in bargain prices, the pendulum may be shifting back. Then again, most newcomers in the Inland Empire are Hispanic, and came from Los Angeles or you won't have Spanish-language new home ads. Oh well + 13:37, 18 June\"\n",

      "From the Boston Globe:Lieberman, a Democrat who won reelection as an independent, also said he wants to be called an Independent Democrat.A strong backer of the Iraq war, Lieberman was returned to office on Election Day with strong GOP support. He ran as an independent after he lost the Democratic primary in August to Ned Lamont.He said yesterday on NBC's \"\"Meet the Press\"\" that he will begin his new term as a Democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership. The senator is in line to become chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\"\"I'm going to caucus with the Democrats both because it's good for my constituents in Connecticut, because I retained my seniority, I become a committee chair, but also I want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security, foreign policy, and innovation and progress in domestic policy,\"\" Lieberman said.He said that because voters returned him to Capitol Hill as an independent, \"\"I am now an Independent Democrat  capital I, capital D. Matter of fact, the secretary of the Senate called my office and asked, 'How do you want to be identified,' and that's it. Independent Democrat,\"\" the senator said.With many Senate Democrats having campaigned or raised money for Lamont, as the party's nominee, Lieberman acknowledged that it might be \"\"a little awkward\"\" for him back in Washington.\"\"They played by the traditional partisan political playbook. And I can't say I enjoyed it, but we're all grown-ups, we've got a job to do, and I'm going to do my best to get that job done,\"\" Lieberman said.Democrats will hold a 51-49 edge in the Senate, so Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, could find himself courted by Republicans.He was asked about the possibility that he might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as Democrats sought to enforce party discipline, particularly if the GOP offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniority.\"\"I'm not ruling it out, but I hope I don't get to that point. And, and I must say, and with all respect to the Republicans who supported me in Connecticut, nobody ever said, 'We're doing this because we, we want you to switch over,' \"\" he said.\"\"I believe that the American people are considering both major political parties to be in a kind of probation, because they're understandably angry that Washington is dominated too much by partisan political games, and not enough by problem-solving and patriotism, which means put the country and your state first,\"\" Lieberman said.In 2001, Senator James Jeffords [Addition by Hodgdon's secret garden: (\"\"D.\"\")] of Vermont abandoned the GOP and aligned himself with the Democrats, putting them in control of the evenly divided Senate. The switch made him a hero among Democrats and a traitor among Republicans.Lieberman said Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia listed himself as an Independent Democrat in the late 1970s. Before that, the last senator to use the designation was in the mid-19th century, he said.link  17:36\"\n",

      "First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, staring with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to follow.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along (I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of my own hand-picked mentors () when I came back to Wikipedia after a long break.)\n",

Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.

      "Dear 206.186.8.130... I have been quite content to leave Dyukov described as a historian Novosti, the state news agency, trots out to dispute Baltic lies about history. (One of several of my edits deleted, each replaced by a more strident defense of Dyukov's credentials.) Given Dyukov's command of basic facts is worse than the factual improprieties he alleges in the film, he already commands far too much space devoted to his views. However, since English-speaking viewersto whom this encyclopedia is targetedget to see Dyukov quite often on \"\"Russia Today\"\" (Novosti's version of CNN or the BBC News), I'm supportive of leaving his commentary in (other editors have mass deleted it). Dyukov's spokesmanship as a historian \"\"specializing\"\" in Soviet history and in debunking, in particular, Baltic \"\"myths\"\" (he uses stronger words in his Novosti interviews) is notable whether I like it or not. However, his POV and role in the official Russian (not independent) media must remain in the article for his presence in the article to be understood and defended.\n",
      "   As for my \"\"principles\"\", they are to representing the parties and their relationships to their establishments accurately. It's obviously simpler to delete undiscussed POV anonymous IP edits as vandalism if they have no reasonable basis in actuality. But whether you register or not, whether you choose to reveal yourself or not, any edit that portrays Dyukov as a reputable historian and ignores his incestuous relationship with the Russian state media agency will continue to be deleted as totally POV.\n",
      "   Your tone of questions communicates to me a wish to be blunt. I'll be happy to oblige. Writing that Dyukov is a \"\"professional historian\"\" here and that he isn't should be discussed elsewhere amounts to nothing but asking the editors here to ignore facts and to lie under the pretext of \"\"NPOV.\"\" —  \"\n",

      "First frame of reference: Antiochus IV Epiphanes as per the Book of Daniel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Revelation, John borrowed the \"\"Son of Perdition\"\" concept from the prophecies of Daniel, relating them by language. He refers to \"\"the star that fell from heaven\"\" by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. The Greek name is \"\"Appolyon,\"\" from the Greek root word \"\"apolumi.\"\" It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation.\"\" The Hebrew name is \"\"Abaddon,\"\" from the Hebrew root word \"\"'abad,\"\" which means the same thing as the Greek root word. In the Book of Daniel, the interpreter says that the eventual destiny of the \"\"great beast\"\" is to be \"\"destroyed\"\" ('abad), and given to the eternal flames (i.e. hell).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that many historians, critics, and many Jewish and Christian scholars believe that the Book of Daniel is about the events in Israel from the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity to the end of the Maccabean Revolt, they would say that the reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying \"\"Theos Epiphanes\"\" (God manifest), etc.\n",

      "Hi it has come to my attention that it is only the english articles that uses \"\"MRT\"\" instead of \"\"MPT\"\" which is used in the rest of other language wiki articles especially the Macedonian one. Debunking your romanized alphabet argument, it could be seen how even the logo has put \"\"MPT\"\" in a romanized alphabet form therefore should be the one to be followed. It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is \"\"Folkswagen\"\" but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article \"\"Macedonian Radio Television\"\" that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki. But its acronym should not be meddled upon especially it has a logo to prove it and the main article could provide the knowledge why MPT and what is its translation to english.Lastly the MRT 1 and MRT 2 pages should be really up for a disambiguation as the MRT worldwide may refer to Mass Rapid Transit or an equivalent rail term.   \"\n",

My argument is that your claim is soapboxing, something not supported in the sources.  There are no sources that say those other ideologies are \"\"just as diverse\"\".  Besides, the issue isn't about diversity, it's about how related they are, whether all the ideologies have common roots from which they all evolved, or whether they have distinct unrelated sources.   The complete dearth of sources describing any one of those other ideological labels as being comprised of distinct ideologies with original unrelated sources is telling.  They are not \"\"just as diverse\"\".  What is deficient about this argument?  It makes no reliance on all sources about libertarianism making this observation.  By the way, referring to the distinct ideologies as \"\"variants\"\" does not preclude the possibility of them being distinct with separate/unrelated origins.No one is questioning the complexity of Conservatism et. al.  Yet that article never-the-less correctly associates the topic of that article with the political ideology of the U.S Republican party, just as this article should associate the topic of this article with the political ideology of the U.S. Libertarian Party, something you oppose (see below).    \n",

      " Hello, Callmemirela! It is nice to meet you. Your help in improving the page for Criminal Minds (season 11), specifically the episode section, is much appreciated!I'm glad you kept me on my toes about putting the episode summary in my own words, so as not to violate any copyright laws; for that I'm quite grateful to you. Criminal Minds is, by far, my favorite show and I love to help keep fellow fans informed.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in my entire time editing Criminal Minds pages - which has been a little while; while I am fairly new to Wikipedia, this account was created with the (2) at the end because my previous account of the same name was inaccessible because I forgot my password lol - I have not once, by any editor, been asked/required to provide refernces for the production codes. Title, writer, director, and air date absolutely require references! But the production code is usually confirmed in one of the references whether it be title, writer, director, air date or any combination therein, added to the fact that the air dates can help determine the order in which the episodes will air, they are almost always confirmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although, I have come to understand there can be an exception in which the production codes can serve quite useful! This is when episodes air out of order, an example of which would be in Season 10, 1006, \"\"Boxed In\"\", was aired before 1005, \"\"If the Shoe Fits\"\", because \"\"Boxed In\"\" was the Halloween episode and it was scheduled to air on 11/05 whereas \"\"If the Shoe Fits\"\" was scheduled to air on 10/29; to resolve this, they merely switched their air dates, however, the production codes remained the same, therefore letting people know that they were aired out of order to accommodate Halloween. In that case, I believe it was briefly required to include references with the production codes. That, however, was the only time I've ever been required to provide a reference for a production code.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've posted references for all of the upcoming production codes to satisfy your need for me to do so and prove to you that I would not post those codes without knowing that their validity can eventually be found through other references. In conclusion, I absolutely agree with you that I needed to avoid violating copyright by denoting the summaries in a vernacular (lexicon; vocabulary; my own words) more unique to me, basically, to make them be more so in my own words, but I don't agree that the production codes need referencing. You are the first person who has ever asked me to do so. I do want you to know, though, that I always use reliable references for my episode title, writer, director and/or air date contributions, and that I take copyright violation (avoiding it!) very seriously!\n",
      "\n",
      "I really appreciate your willingness to help make the page as accurate as possible; that is my objective as well. I just don't think that it is necessary to reference the production codes, since all episodes have aired in order, thus far, and we (the fans) have been given no reason to believe they won't continue to do so. When it is required due to scheduling changes, I'd be happy to post it. I hope we can resolve this minor misunderstanding. Happy editing!\n",

For that reason I'm not sure if \"\"bureaucracy\"\" is the best way to describe the corps of admins, or the dangers threatened by their expansion. The more plausible fear, I think, is that too many admins will result in a \"\"police state\"\", with more sped-up deletes, heavy-handed blocks, and POV enforcement. I am certainly opposed to any movement in the direction of stifling unpopular POVs. I'm not sure that the number of admins is the major factor though. Another view, which I don't endorse either, is that having more admins broadens involvement and reduces the relative power of any one admin. I think that the most important issues are probably the rules and procedures, official and unofficial, that admins follow and/or enforce on others, Those powers should stay limited. - 05:26, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)\n",

Regardless of how fleshed out your criteria becomes, criterion by criterion, I must still have to agree with the content of this organizations decisions on who Rand is and what she left to posterity.  If I didn't do so, acting as the final arbitrator of my existence (or my interaction within reality) who will?  Existence and existents hold the validity (or lack thereof) of my perceptions, my concepts, my decisions, consequences of my ethics, etc.  Not Wikipedia.  Certainly not you who thinks such a thought nonsense.  And I have all her texts, I'm quite aware of her ideas. Making assumptions without checking on premises is what landed Rand's page in this editing nightmare.

Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.\n",

      "All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.\n",

      " Thanks for the compliment! It's true, content is my main passion. I am happiest when doing lots of content creation/editing and community building, and I believe I do my best work when happy, and am least likely to get testy or make rash decisions. I tend to go through cycles in my editing. Recently, there's been a great deal of content creation that interests me, so that's what I've been most focused on. (A major recent exception would be the discussion of image placeholders, which has involved doing a lot of work to try to determine consensus from a broad segment of the WP community.) When I get less inspired on content, I tend to go on Recent changes patrol, jump into an XfD or RfA debate, etc. In my opinion, it is a good thing to have administrators who are heavily focused on content, and make brief forays into administrative duties. I recognize that some hold differing views; to them I would say, it's essential that an administrator have sufficient experience with things like image licensing and fair use, other projects like Commons and Wikinews, deletion debates, mediation, etc. to act accordingly. I certainly feel that I have enough experience with that stuff. I have nominated numerous articles for deletion, using speedy, PROD and AfD procedures; I don't know a good way to assess the results, but my sense is that the most of my recommendations have been approved. I do lots of vandalism reversion, and would estimate that I include subst'ed  templates about 80% of the time. I have recommended the occasional block for stuff like 3RR. I participate in CfD's and IfD's. I'm familiar with lots of criteria (like speedy delete); I would not claim to know any by rote, but my familiarity makes it possible to read up on something and act pretty quickly.\n",

      "\n",
      "I recall Hurricanes Bonnie and Charley hitting Florida within a day of each other, and both of them passing off the Jersey Shore a few days later.  It was the remnants of Charley, not Bonnie, which brought the heaviest rain to the Jersey Shore on August 15th, 2004. Bonnie might have spread some light rain a day or two earlier, I don't specifically remember, but Charley passed off our coast as a 40 mile per hour tropical storm. I remember this clearly because the most intense wind and rain were far ahead of Charley's center, and when the center was closest, there was no rain or wind to speak of onshore, mostly offshore. Earlier that day, Charley had been a Category One hurricane off of South Carolina, and a day or two before that, a monster Category 4, hitting Punta Gorda, Florida. Later that season, New Jersey got rains from the remnants of Frances, Gaston, Ivan & Jeanne. Jeanne was the strongest, and brought the most intense winds of that season, although Charley was far wetter. I will try to find sources to back this up, but I have followed every New Jersey tropical storm & hurricane since 1976, and work in the Office of Emergency Management. Some of the worst conditions I've ever experienced were during the passage of Tropical Storm Ernesto in 2006, because the wind and rain lasted a long, long time: about two days, with frequent gusts near hurricane force, even over that threshold just south of here..  Floyd, Bertha, Gloria and Belle were  stronger, but they moved faster. My community, Seaside Heights was in the direct center of 70 mph Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999, with a dead calm lasting about an hour, sandwiched between periods very, very wind conditions. Hanna in '08 was the biggest wimp of all these storms: a bit of rain and wind, but mostly hype.\n",

      "I'm not criticizing you here, but I truly don't understand why people from time to time make that comment, that is is irrelevant. It is a major component of identity, far more than say LGBT or political party. Anyway, the reason why I was compelled to ask the question is that I read an article about her new book regarding Revelations in the New Yorker and it was very anti-Christian. I then over the following weekend read an article in the Wall Street Journal about this same book and it was more even handed. It made the book sound very intriguing and a good work of scholarship. So I was using Wiki as a tool to help try and see whether or not it was the author of the New Yorker article or the author of the book who was the bigot; or rather whose perspective was being presented in the article. So if Wiki said that she is some type of devout Christian or proud of her Christian heritage, I would be able to make a better determination of which article was more neutral. Or if it said that she was a Cultural Marxist ditto. This is precisely what Wiki is there to help us with. It might sound mundane but if I had all the information that I needed then I would have been able to make the decision to purchase the book. So instead of Wikipedia, I had to read the reviews on Amazon. Ergo, Wiki did not provide all the relevant info I needed. Thanks!\n",

      "\n",
      "1) The article began with the expression \"\"Gibraltar (...) is a self-governing British overseas territory (...)\"\". This was not supported by any objective reference in the article and, in fact, it is something not endorsed by the UN (see below), which at least provides some ground for not accepting the self-government of Gibraltar as a self-evident fact. Therefore, I substituted it for some referenced facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) The article referenced the fact that Gibraltar is on the UN's non self-governing territories list but British and Gibraltarian polititians think that it should be removed. Only it was lost somewhere in the middle of this (long) article. I repositioned this information to the introduction of the article where it summarises the territory's political nature. It does not matter if 50 years ago it was the UK who nominated Gibraltar for the list: this status is reviewed every year and has not yet been reverted by UN's Special Committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "What surprises me is: I would have expected that if you disagree with my edits, you would discuss them or, if you think they do not offer a holistic view, you complete them with additional referenced facts. Instead of that, you just deleted the edits and accused me of edit warring.\n",

      "If you want to discuss this the appropriate place is the talk page of the article, not here as this is not a matter between you and justin.  The reality is that since the 2006 constitution Gibraltar is manifestly self governing, sadly progress on delisting it by the UN C24 is hampered by Spain's foolish attitude and intransigence.  It is amusing that that committee is comprised of representatives of states with less democracy than Gibraltar and if you follow the proceedings they have been singularly useless in achieving anything in relation to their remit on ANY territory such that the GoG declined to attend further meetings.  In relation to the politics of Gibralar, which is what the article is about, the UN is irrelevent - indeed the committee has not even visited the territory in question despite being invited to do so by the GoG and the UK. They are not so much a paper tiger as a limp piece of used bog roll.   \n",

      "Please do not insult my intelligence that your intentions were anything other than to push a POV with that edit.  The facts remain that Gibraltar is self-governing.  It is only Spain that for its own political agenda denies this and the UN C24 is discussed in the article.  Your POV edit sought to give those facts WP:UNDUE prominence.  Your behaviour was also to edit war to keep that edit, hence my warning was appropriate.  And as Gibnews points out the correct place for that discussion was the article talk page. '''' talk \"\n",

      " \"\"Vocalizations\"\" is a rare word for me, and not very specific, it seems to mean anything produced with the voice, from words to shouts to song. If I read that, I would think it actually meant coprolalia, while I think what the source means is that he tends to express himself heatedly in discussions, which is why I liked \"\"outburst\"\", which, to me, means passionate words, but not nonsense. A side comment; when I was expanding the article, I actually wrote to him, and asked if he would be willing to release a freely licensed picture. He wrote me quite a lot about how the Wikipedia mistreated him, and after a few back and forths, wouldn't release a picture if I couldn't guarantee our article would name specific Wikipedia editors who mistreated him. No obscenities were involved, but I could almost read him becoming heated as he typed.  (squeak) \"\n",
